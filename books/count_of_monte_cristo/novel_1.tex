Alexandre Dumas was born in 1802 at Villers-Cotter\^ets. His father, the
illegitimate son of a marquis, was a general in the Revolutionary
armies, but died when Dumas was only four. He was brought up in
straitened circumstances and received very little education. He joined
the household of the future king, Louis-Philippe, and began reading
voraciously. Later he entered the \emph{c\'enacle} of Charles Nodier and
started writing. In 1829 the production of his play, \emph{Henri III et
sa cour}, heralded twenty years of successful playwriting. In 1839 he
turned his attention to writing historical novels, often using
collaborators such as Auguste Maquet to suggest plots or historical
background. His most successful novels are \emph{The Count of Monte
Cristo}, which appeared during 1844--5, and \emph{The Three Musketeers},
published in 1844. Other novels deal with the wars of religion and the
Revolution. Dumas wrote many of these for the newspapers, often in daily
instalments, marshalling his formidable energies to produce ever more in
order to pay off his debts. In addition, he wrote travel books,
children's stories and his \emph{M\'emoires} which describe most amusingly
his early life, his entry into Parisian literary circles and the 1830
Revolution. He died in 1870.

separates from Ida Ferrier.

\item[\textbf{1845}] \emph{Twenty Years After}, the first sequel to \emph{The
Three Musketeers}, appears at the beginning of the year. In February,
Dumas wins a libel action against the author of a book accusing him of

\mychapterstar{Introduction}

`Ah, a children's novel,' a Russian film-maker remarked when I told her
that I was translating \emph{The Count of Monte Cristo}. The comment was
not intended to be disparaging, merely descriptive; and many people, in
different cultures, would tend to agree with the categorization. Most
will derive their idea of the novel, not from having read it, but
because a kind of abstract of the storyline exists as part of the common
culture: innocent man imprisoned, meets fellow-prisoner who directs him
to a buried fortune, escapes and plots revenge. It has been adapted for
film, television and the theatre, as well as being translated, abridged
and imitated in print. It has supplied material for cartoons and comedy:
the Irish comedian Dave Allen used to do a series of sketches around the
theme of a young man (Dant\`es) breaking through a dungeon wall and
encountering an old, bearded prisoner (Abb\'e Faria). Some events in the
story are so well-known that they exist apart from the novel, like
Robinson Crusoe's discovery of Man Friday's footprint, or incidents and
characters from \emph{Treasure Island} and \emph{Frankenstein}.
\emph{The Count of Monte Cristo} is one of the great popular novels of
all time and, like other popular novels, it has suffered the fate of
being treated as not fully `adult' fiction; like children's fiction, it
seems to inhabit a realm outside its creator's biography and the period
when it was written.

On the other hand, there are not many children's books, even in our own
time, that involve a female serial poisoner, two cases of infanticide, a
stabbing and three suicides; an extended scene of torture and execution;
drug-induced sexual fantasies, illegitimacy, transvestism and
lesbianism; a display of the author's classical learning, and his
knowledge of modern European history, the customs and diet of the
Italians, the effects of hashish, and so on; the length would, in any
case, immediately disqualify it from inclusion in any modern series of
books for children. Most important of all, perhaps, is the fact that the
author himself never thought of this as `a children's novel'. Yet
already in the earliest translations into English, with their omission
or subtle alteration of material that might be considered indelicate by
Victorian readers, and of some passages (for example, references to
classical literature) that might be thought to hold up the story, one
can see the start of a process of transformation, from `novel' to `genre
novel' -- which means, ultimately, almost any kind of genre novel:
`adventure', `romance', `thriller' and, if you like, `children's novel'.
This is the usual fate of books that fail to meet the criteria for
serious, `literary' fiction.

Dumas himself must bear some of the responsibility. During his most
productive decade, from 1841 to 1850, he wrote forty-one novels,
twenty-three plays, seven historical works and half a dozen travel
books. The nineteenth century was an age of mass production, which is
precisely why Art felt the need to distinguish itself by its
individuality and craftsmanship: `Alexandre Dumas and Co., novel
factory', was the contemptuous title given to one critical pamphlet,
published at the same time as this novel, in 1845. Moreover it was known
that Dumas wrote for money, at so much a line, and that he used at least
one collaborator, Auguste Maquet, who would make chapter outlines for
him and do research. There was a vast difference between this industrial
labour and the monastic devotion to the cause of art that kept Gustave
Flaubert at his desk for seven hours a day as he wrote and rewrote
\emph{Madame Bovary} (1857). In the history of the novel, Dumas and
Flaubert stand near the head of divergent streams.

Alexandre Dumas was born on 24 July 1802; or, rather, since the
Republican Calendar was still in force, on 5th Thermidor, Year x, in the
little town of Villers-Cotter\^ets, near Soissons. His father was a
general in the revolutionary armies, himself the illegitimate son of a
marquis, Antoine-Alexandre Davy de la Paillerie, and a black slave from
the island of Santo Domingo, Marie Dumas. In 1806, General Dumas died,
leaving his family virtually without resources. The child had little
education, enough however to allow him to read \emph{Robinson Crusoe}
and \emph{The Arabian Nights}, and to cultivate his handwriting. In
1823, thanks to the second of these, he found employment in Paris,
copying documents for Louis-Philippe, Duke of Orl\'eans.

The 1820s were a marvellous time for an aspiring young writer in Paris.
The two rival literary ideologies, of Classicism and Romanticism, were
engaged in a mock-heroic combat for the soul of French literature.
Classicism stood for universal themes, refinement, purity of language,
clear division of literary genres and (despite its debt to the
literature of the classical world) the peculiarly French ethos of the
dramatist Racine. Romanticism meant energy, modern subject-matter,
mixing genres and openness to foreign influences, particularly that of
Shakespeare, the Romantic dramatist \emph{par excellence}. It was in the
theatre that the confrontation would chiefly take place.

Racine had based his plays on stories from classical Greece or on
biblical history, both of which offered `universal' events and
characters. Shakespeare, like the German playwright Schiller, had dealt
with subjects from modern history, which were national and particular
rather than universal. In France, especially, the period that followed
the great upheavals of the Revolution, the Empire and the Restoration
was one which had an urgent need to make sense of the past.
Shakespeare's history plays -- and, still more, the historical novels of
Walter Scott -- were models of how this could be done, drawing on the
imagination as well as on scholarship. In 1828, Dumas, who had already
tried his hand at a couple of plays and some short stories, submitted a
historical drama to the Com\'edie Fran\c{c}aise entitled \emph{Henri III et sa
cour}. It was a typically Romantic work, ignoring the `unities' of time,
place and action, and written in prose, rather than the conventional
medium of verse. It underwent the usual ritual of a public reading and,
at its first night on 10 February 1829, scored a triumphant success and
was warmly applauded by the author's employer, Louis-Philippe. In the
following year, Louis-Philippe became king, after a liberal revolution
that was supposed to bring in a constitutional monarchy. Dumas welcomed
it; so did the former ultra-monarchist, Victor Hugo.

During the next twenty years, Dumas was (with Hugo and Alfred de Vigny)
the leading dramatist of the new movement -- and, of the three, easily
the most prolific. Perhaps too much so: overnight, after the first
performance of \emph{Christine} in 1830, while Dumas was asleep, Hugo
and Vigny rewrote the play, reducing it to a more manageable size.
Despite this, Dumas' play \emph{Antony} (1831) is an essential work of
the Romantic period, as representative as Hugo's \emph{Hernani} or
Vigny's \emph{Chatterton}, and more successful with its audiences than
either. But the theatre is the very opposite of a monastic cell or an
ivory tower. Collaboration is not only the norm, but inevitable,
feedback from the public is instantaneous, work has to be produced to
satisfy demand, and there is an immediate relationship between the
author's output and what comes in through the box office. In the
theatre, Dumas learned the rudiments of literary production.

On one occasion, Charles-Jean Harel, director of the Od\'eon theatre, is
supposed to have locked Dumas into a room, away from his mistress, for a
week, until he had completed the manuscript of \emph{Napol\'eon} (1831).
The huge growth in the periodical press during the 1820s saw the
invention of the \emph{feuilleton} -- not in the sense of a regular
column by one writer, but of a novel published in instalments; Dumas
claimed to have invented the \emph{roman feuilleton} with \emph{La
Comtesse de Salisbury}, published in \emph{La Presse} in 1836. By the
early 1840s he was writing more novels than plays, mainly (but by no
means exclusively) historical fiction which, as I have already
mentioned, was one of the most popular genres; it was also taken
seriously as a means of exploring the past. He did, incidentally, write
a book for children at this time: \emph{Le Capitaine Pamphile} (1839).

Travel, to which he was addicted, helped to stave off boredom, providing
the material for travel books, while translation filled in the remaining
gaps in the working day. Like Balzac, he was a man of huge appetites:
food, sex, work, sleep, pleasure, leisure, movement, excitement. In
Italy, he found love, opera, colour and the Mediterranean: he visited
Naples and Palermo in 1835, stayed a year in Florence in 1841 and
returned in 1843 for a visit that included Sicily. The following year
saw the publication of his first great historical novel, \emph{Les Trois
Mousquetaires/The Three Musketeers}, and on 28 August 1844 \emph{Le
Journal des D\'ebats} began publication of \emph{The Count of Monte
Cristo}. It was an immediate success, translated, adapted, pirated
\ldots{} in short, a popular novel.

\bigskip

\noindent It was also, very clearly, a work of its time. The plot was inspired by
the true-life story of Fran\c{c}ois Picaud, which Dumas found in Jacques
Peuchet's \emph{Police d\'evoil\'ee: M\'emoires historiques tir\'es des archives
de Paris} \ldots{} (1838), a collection of anecdotes from the Parisian
police archives.\textsuperscript{1}

Briefly, the story is this: Picaud, a young man from the south of
France, was imprisoned in 1807, having been denounced by a group of
friends as an English spy, shortly after he had become engaged to a
young woman called Marguerite. The denunciation was inspired by a caf\'e
owner, Mathieu Loupian, who was jealous of Picaud's relationship with
Marguerite.

Picaud was eventually moved to a form of house-arrest in Piedmont and
shut up in the castle of Fenestrelle, where he acted as servant to a
rich Italian cleric. When the man died, abandoned by his family, he left
his money to Picaud, whom he had come to treat as a son, also informing
him of the whereabouts of a hidden treasure. With the fall of Napoleon
in 1814, Picaud, now called Joseph Lucher, was released; in the
following year, after collecting the hidden treasure, he returned to
Paris.

Here he discovered that Marguerite had married Loupian. Disguising
himself, and offering a valuable diamond to Allut, the one man in the
group who had been unwilling to collaborate in the denunciation, he
learned the identity of his enemies. He then set about eliminating them,
stabbing the first with a dagger on which were printed the words:
`Number One', and burning down Loupian's caf\'e. He managed to find
employment in Loupian's house, disguised as a servant called Prosper.
However, while this was going on, Allut had fallen out with the merchant
to whom he had resold the diamond, had murdered him and had been
imprisoned. On coming out of jail, he started to blackmail Picaud.
Picaud poisoned another of the conspirators, lured Loupian's son into
crime and his daughter into prostitution, then finally stabbed Loupian
himself. But he quarrelled with Allut over the blackmail payments and
Allut killed him, confessing the whole story on his deathbed in 1828.

It is obvious both how directly Dumas was inspired by Peuchet's account
of this extraordinary tale, and how radically he transformed it;
incidentally, he used another chapter of Peuchet's book as the basis for
the story of Mme de Villefort. One important step in the transformation
from `true crime' to fiction was to shift the opening of the tale from
Paris to Marseille, giving the novel its Mediterranean dimension. Though
most of the action still takes place in Paris (apart from a few
excursions elsewhere, all the novel between Chapters {\small XXXIX} and {\small CIV} is
set in Paris), the sea is always present as a figure for escape and
freedom, while the novel uses the southern origins of its characters as
a means to evoke that exotic world of the Mediterranean littoral that
had so fascinated French writers and artists since the 1820s. The
Mediterranean is the point where the cultures of Europe meet those of
the Orient, and the region had been in the forefront of people's minds
since the 1820s, because of the Greek struggle for independence and the
French conquest of Algeria.

Both of these are directly present in the novel: one of its young
characters is a soldier who has just returned from Algeria, another sets
off to fight in the colony. As for Greece, which rebelled against the
Turks in the 1820s, it inspired much fervour among European Romantics,
most famously Lord Byron. The story of Ali (1741--1822), Pasha of Janina
(Jannina) in Albania, plays a direct part in the novel and also takes us
into the Oriental world that fascinated the French Romantics. `The
Orient,' Victor Hugo wrote in the preface to his early collection of
poems, \emph{Les Orientales} (1829), `both as an image and as an idea,
has become a sort of general preoccupation for people's minds as much as
for their imaginations, to which the author has perhaps unwittingly
succumbed. As if of their own accord, Oriental colours have come to
stamp their mark on all his thoughts and reveries \ldots' -- as they
also marked the paintings of Ingres and Delacroix. When we meet Hayd\'ee
in Chapter {\small XLIX}, she is lying on a heap of
cushions, wearing her native Albanian costume, smoking a hookah and
framed in a doorway, `like a charming painting'.

Italy was another Mediterranean land that held a powerful appeal for the
Romantics, and in particular for Dumas. All the components of this
appeal are in the novel: the classical world (the night visit to the
Colosseum), the excitement of travel (Chapter {\small XXXIII}, `Roman Bandits'),
the cruel justice of the Papal states (Chapter {\small XXXV}, `La Mazzolata'), colourful
spectacle (Chapter {\small XXXVI}, `The Carnival in Rome'), the Christian
past (Chapter {\small XXXVII}, `The
Catacombs of Saint Sebastian'). The story of Luigi Vampa could have come
directly from one of Stendhal's \emph{Italian Chronicles}, the
description of the Colosseum at night from one of Byron's or Shelley's
letters. There is also a good deal of wit -- and the fruit of personal
experience -- in Dumas' portrayal of the modern Romans and the
day-by-day experience of the Grand Tour. Like all the most skilled
popular writers, he offers his readers a mixture of the unfamiliar and
the expected: references to places, people and events that will conjure
up a whole complex of images and ideas -- we have here the notion of
Italy as it was perceived in France in the 1840s, through literature and
art -- combined with those intimate touches that allow readers to
experience the sensations of being there. Reading Dumas, we know how it
felt to be swept up in the crowd at the Carnival, to travel in a
carriage through the Roman streets, to stay in a \emph{pensione}. We can
easily recognize the proud bandit, the bustling hotelier, the alluring
woman in the Carnival crowd.

All these are described with as much economy as possible in order to
avoid holding up the narrative. This is one reason why the popular novel
tends to reinforce rather than to challenge prejudices -- although, in
one case, Dumas' novel reversed a prejudice, namely that Marseille was,
in the words of Murray's \emph{Handbook for Travellers in France}
(1847), `a busy and flourishing city \ldots{} {[}but one that{]} has few
fine public buildings or sights for strangers'. \emph{The Count of Monte
Cristo}, on the contrary, with its intimate topography of the area
around the old port and its dramatization of Marseille as the focus of
mercantile activity, the meeting-place of Mediterranean cultures and the
gateway to the Arab Maghreb, is a good deal more flattering than
Murray's \emph{Handbook}. Dumas was allegedly thanked by a Marseillais
cab-driver for promoting the city.

Apart from this novel depiction of France's major sea-port, however,
Dumas offers his readers a Rome, and an Orient, that are very much what
they would expect: the first colourful, tuneful, proud and cruel, the
second decadent and opulent. But he adds those little details that
compel belief in what he is describing: the precise information about
Carnival etiquette, the street-by-street itinerary of a drive round the
walls of Rome, the horrifying description of a Roman execution, sketches
of character or scenery that he has culled from his own memories of
staying at Signor Pastrini's hotel when he visited Rome in 1835. His
passages on sailing ships spare us none of the technicalities of sails
and masts; his descriptions of the effects of opium convince us that he
had experienced them. And, in much the same way, he adds touches of
erudition: a quotation from Horace, a reference to \emph{Hamlet} -- all
of which are meant to reassure us that we are in reliable hands. At
times he even allows himself the luxury of a longer purple passage
(perhaps a sunset over the Mediterranean) to show that he can do that,
too.

All this helps to justify his claim that he has transformed Peuchet's
material into something infinitely more valuable. Peuchet's account of
the Picaud case, he wrote, was `simply ridiculous \ldots{} {[}but{]}
inside this oyster, there was a pearl. A rough, shapeless pearl, of no
value, waiting for its jeweller.' And, of course, the essential
transformation that the jeweller makes to Peuchet's story lies in the
character of the Count.

To begin with, we have Edmond Dant\`es, a man who could well be first
cousin to the shoemaker, Fran\c{c}ois Picaud. Betrayed by a jealous rival
and an ambitious colleague, sent to the fortress prison of If by a
magistrate who cannot afford to let the facts come out, Dant\`es goes
through a kind of burial and resurrection. Educated by Abb\'e Faria and
possessor of a limitless fortune, he can re-emerge into the world, not
as the cobbler Picaud, content to stab or poison those responsible for
his misfortune, but as an instrument of divine justice. Dumas' first,
vital departure from Peuchet is to make Monte Cristo only indirectly the
avenger: his `victims' are all, in reality, destroyed by their own past
misdeeds which Monte Cristo uncovers.

As the man who brings the truth to light and uses the discovery to
punish the wrongdoer, Monte Cristo is the forerunner of the detective,
that central figure in modern popular fiction. In fact, there is more
than one reference in the novel to deductive methods that resemble those
pioneered by Edgar Allan Poe (`A Manuscript Found in a Bottle', `The
Gold Bug', `The Murders in the Rue Morgue') -- for example, in the way
in which Abb\'e Faria deciphers the will showing where the treasure was
hidden, Dant\`es' own analysis of where exactly it is concealed on the
island and, earlier, Faria's explanation of Dant\`es' imprisonment. Note
that, like the intellectual exercises of Monte Cristo's opium-taking
successor later in the century, Sherlock
Holmes,\textsuperscript{2} these deductions at
first amaze those who have not been able to follow the logic behind them
or who do not have the expertise to know, for example, when something
has been written with the left hand by a right-handed person. But, of
course, Faria is not really a Holmesian detective: the stereotype in
Dumas' mind is that of the eighteenth-century \emph{philosophe}, a
believer in the power of reason and a student of human nature. What
Faria lacks (ironically, since everyone around thinks him mad, insanely
obsessed with his fictitious treasure) is the Holmesian neuroses: the
brooding violin and the opium stupor. These come from a different
fictional archetype.

So does Monte Cristo, even though he is not averse at times to applying
Faria's deductive logic (and shares Holmes's talent for disguise).
Having emerged in 1829 from his entombment, found his treasure,
discovered the fate of his father and Merc\'ed\`es, and repaid his debt to
Morrel, Dant\`es then disappears for another nine years, about which the
reader is told virtually nothing. This second period of latency is not
strictly a remaking but an effacement: the character who re-emerges in
the novel as the Count of Monte Cristo is shrouded in mystery; we only
assume, at first, that he is identical to Edmond Dant\`es on the slender
evidence of their using the same pseudonym: `Sinbad the Sailor'. He is a
dark, brooding figure, pale-faced, with an aversion to food and
apparently devoid of some human feelings: he takes an evil delight in
terrifying his young friends, Albert and Franz, with the spectacle of an
execution. He is also, as they learn later, on good terms with the
bandit, Luigi Vampa.

The appearance of this deathly-white apparition in a box at the Roman
opera immediately evokes two other personalities who played a major role
in popular mythology in France in the Romantic era. The first is Lord
Byron, a real-life character who very early was confused with his
fictional creations, Childe Harold, Manfred and Don Juan -- all the more
so in France, where the poetry might be known only in translation. The
image was that of a young but world-weary hero, tormented by nameless
despairs. The second figure was that of the vampire, associated with the
first through the story \emph{Lord Ruthwen, or The Vampire}, which was
attributed to Byron (though in fact written by his companion, Polidori).
This was not by any means the only vampire to be found in France at the
time: the theatre, notably during the 1820s, was haunted by the Undead:
English vampires, comic vampires, female vampires \ldots{} The nature of
the vampire was perhaps not so precisely codified as it was to be later,
especially by Bram Stoker in that tale of another mysterious count:
garlic, stakes, crosses, Transylvania, the vampire's native soil in the
coffin which he keeps in the basement, these are not yet firmly
established in the mythology. But the figure is there, and elements of
the legend are specifically ascribed to the Byronic figure of Monte
Cristo.

What I would like to suggest is that Dumas' novel stands at a crucial
point in the development of modern popular fiction, drawing into the
genre elements from Romantic literature, popular theatre, history and
actuality, and wrapping them up in a narrative carefully enough
constructed and dramatic enough to hold the attention of a growing
reading public with a great appetite for fiction. They would satisfy it
not only with books, but also with the newspaper serials which had
brought fame and fortune to Dumas' precursor in the genre, Eug\`ene Sue.

\emph{Monte Cristo} owes its existence directly to Sue's \emph{Myst\`eres
de Paris} (1842--3): it was precisely the success of Sue's tales that
made Dumas' publishers demand a novel, rather than the historical guide
to Paris that they had originally commissioned. Sue's appeal to the
public was the ability to suggest the existence of a sinister underworld
of crime and intrigue behind the fa\c{c}ade of a Paris that was familiar to
most of his readers. The growth of the nineteenth-century metropolis led
to a whole literature of the urban life, later exploited on film, in
which the city is no longer seen as a place of civilized, `urbane'
living and safety from attack, but as a menacing sub-world, in which
human beings prey on one another or suffer fearful bouts of loneliness,
alienation and ennui. A machine devised to supply every need of
civilized humanity in one place has become a monster enclosing every
form of vice and depravity. Only in England did murder continue to take
place in country houses.

As noted earlier, Paris is the setting for the greater part of the book,
but the episodes in Marseille and Rome enrich it enormously. We do have,
at the very centre, a very Parisian murder story, joined to a rather
trite Parisian romance, and Dumas locates every event precisely on the
city map, so that all the addresses are real; but the overall impression
left by the novel is of something far larger in scope than a tale of
Parisian wrongdoing and revenge. The episodes in Marseille and Rome may
have been added after the book was begun -- it was Dumas' collaborator,
Maquet, who suggested actually recounting Dant\`es' arrest and
imprisonment, instead of starting the novel in Rome and then
transferring the action rapidly to Paris; yet the first section proves
absolutely crucial. Where the count, in himself, descends at times to
the level of a melodramatic stage avenger, Dant\`es is a compelling
character, and it is the figure of Edmond Dant\`es (whom we feel obscurely
present in his later incarnation) which gives the latter depth and
weight.

The re-emergence of the other characters after the latency period of
Dant\`es' imprisonment is more of a problem. Caderousse is essentially
unchanged, Danglars more or less unrecognizable. Fernand offers the
least plausible transformation of all, from the brave and honest
Spaniard with a sharp sense of honour, whom we meet in the early
chapters, to the Parisian aristocrat whose life seems to have been
dedicated to a series of betrayals. Fernand/Morcerf seems to confirm a
criticism of Dumas and of popular novels in general, namely that they
tend to sacrifice character to plot.

In some respects, though, in Dumas' novel the reverse is true: Dumas'
novel is dictated by character. But it is character viewed more as an
imaginative construct than as a psychological novelist would conceive
it. The count himself is a poetic character, a creature of the
imagination who draws on elements from myth as much as from everyday
psychological observation. And, while Madame de Villefort, Valentine,
Morrel and some others in Dumas' huge cast may be `flat' characters,
performing a largely functional role in the development of the story,
there are several secondary figures to whom this does not apply, notably
Eug\'enie Danglars and Albert de Morcerf. In many ways, Eug\'enie is
Valentine's twin. Both women are heiresses to large fortunes, both are
presented with the alternatives of subjecting themselves to their
father's will and marrying men whom they do not love or being confined
to a convent. But where Valentine is willing to submit, Eug\'enie is not.
Her lesbianism may be a trait of personality, but it is also an
expression of her desire for independence.

There is far more to \emph{The Count of Monte Cristo} than merely a tale
of adventure and revenge. None the less, it is a book that many people
first encounter and enjoy during their teens. Not long after Dumas'
death, Victor Hugo wrote a letter to his friend's son, Alexandre Dumas
\emph{fils}, in which he praised Dumas as a writer of universal appeal
and added `He creates a thirst for reading.' After more than 150 years,
\emph{The Count of Monte Cristo} remains one of the most popular and
widely read novels in world literature; its longevity singles it out as
almost unique among `popular' novels. For many of its readers, despite
its length, it seems all too short; we want to spend more time with the
count and the other characters in the book, more time in its bustling
world of drama and passion. Creating that thirst for more is among
Dumas' great contributions to literature.

\mychapterstar{A Note on the Text}

\emph{The Count of Monte Cristo} began publication in parts, in the
\emph{Journal des D\'ebats}, in August 1844; this continued until January
1846, by which time the first, 18-volume edition had been published by
P\'etion (1845--6). The second, third and fourth editions appeared in
1846, and there were several pirate editions in the 1840s. The book
continued to be re-published throughout the century, the last edition in
Dumas' lifetime being that published by Michel L\'evy in 1865.

The novel was rapidly translated into English (in England, in
\emph{Ainsworth's Magazine}, 1845, and by Emma Hardy, 1846; and in
America in 1846); and into: Danish (1845--6); Swedish (1846); Italian
(by Oreste Ferrario, 1847); Spanish (1858); Norwegian (1881--2); and
German (1902). The first stage adaptation was the one made by Dumas and
Maquet themselves (in 1848, in two parts; in 1851, in two parts; finally
shown as one single performance, in five acts and 12 tableaux, in 1862).
Long before this, however, there had been a stage parody by Deforges and
Claireville, \emph{Le Comte de Monte-Fiasco} (1847) -- a further tribute
to the notoriety of the work.

The most recent stage version was a new adaptation performed in England
in 1994. There have been condensed editions, children's editions and a
comic-book version. There were film adaptations in 1908 (USA), 1913
(USA), 1914 (France), 1934 (USA), 1942 (France), 1953 (France), 1961
(France), 1975 (USA) and 2001 (USA), as well as television versions. The
strength of the story is enough to explain why the novel has proved so
adaptable to other media, despite its length: the central themes of
betrayal, wrongful imprisonment and revenge are clear enough to allow
many of the sub-plots to be discarded for reasons of time or space.

Inevitably, something will be lost: there is simply so much there; and,
from the earliest days, the process undergone by Dumas' novel was one of
reduction, as if the original was too vast to stand by itself. There is
also the matter of the historical moment at which \emph{The Count of
Monte Cristo} appeared.

The mid-nineteenth century saw a continuing struggle to establish the
credentials of the literary novel, by giving it the dual aims that
Stendhal had helped to pioneer, which were those of exploring the
enduring features of human psychology and analysing a particular state
of human society. In contrast to such enterprises, fiction which
involved larger-than-life characters and implausible situations, Gothic
horrors, melodramatic incidents and so on appeared mere entertainment.
The gradual emergence of realism in the European novel was not
altogether to the advantage of Dumas, whose image was less that of the
austere priest than the jolly friar, and whose novels poured out of a
factory, the purpose of which was to create entertainment and sell it
for money.

This explains why, though Thackeray admitted finding the book impossible
to put down, English novelists like George Eliot considered that `the
French' -- Dumas, Hugo and Balzac -- were mistakenly tempted to deal
with the exception rather than the rule: to look for melodramatic
situations and characters, when they should be exploring the everyday
life that revealed what is enduring in human nature. It is not hard,
anyway, to guess that the author of \emph{Middlemarch} and \emph{The
Mill on the Floss} would not find much to please her in \emph{The Three
Musketeers} or \emph{The Count of Monte Cristo}.

There is also the question of Dumas' style, which is usually
unremarkable; and the fact that he wrote his great novels in
collaboration with Maquet, which does not accord with the idea of the
author as sole creator. No wonder people have thought they could treat
\emph{Monte Cristo} as a treasure-trove rather than a sacred text, or
that the many adaptations, abbreviations and reworkings of it have been
done with a good deal less reverence (and consequently, more often than
not, a good deal more success) than, say, Claude Chabrol brought to his
film version of \emph{Madame Bovary}. In the main, its fate has been
that of most nineteenth-century `adventure' novels: it has been treated
as mere entertainment for adults or literature for the young.

The truth is that, more because of the subject-matter than because of
its length, the novel has had to be tampered with before it can be
offered to young readers; or, as one may conjecture, to readers in
mid-Victorian England. And, because this is merely a `popular' novel, as
well as one which represents a huge amount of work for a translator,
there has been little enthusiasm in the English-speaking world for
re-translating it.

Claude Schopp's edition (Robert Laffont, 1993), which lists the main
foreign translations, records nothing into English since 1910. The most
readily available edition in Britain at the moment reproduces the
anonymous translation first published by Chapman \& Hall in 1846. Its
editor for the Oxford World's Classics series (1990), David Coward,
writes that `with one or two exceptions, the small number of ``new''
translations since made have drawn heavily upon \ldots{} this classic
version'.

Anyone who has read \emph{The Count of Monte Cristo} only in this
`classic version' has never read Dumas' novel. For a start, the
translation is occasionally inaccurate and is written in a
nineteenth-century English that now sounds far more antiquated than the
French of the original does to a modern French reader: to mention one
small point in this connection, Dumas uses a good deal of dialogue (he
wrote by the line), and the constant inversions of `said he' and `cried
he' are both irritating and antiquated. There are some real oddities,
like the attempt to convey popular speech (which does not correspond to
anything in Dumas), when the sailor in Chapter {\small XXV}
says: `that's one of them nabob gentlemen from Ingy
[\emph{sic}], no doubt \ldots' Even aside from that, most of the
dialogues in this nineteenth-century translation, in which the
characters utter sentences like: `I will join you ere long', `I confess
he asked me none' and `When will all this cease?', have the authentic
creak of the Victorian stage boards and the gaslit melodrama.

It can be argued that this language accurately conveys an aspect of
Dumas' work, but not even his worst detractors would pretend that there
is nothing more to it than that. Still less acceptable, however, than
the language of this Victorian translation is the huge number of
omissions and bowdlerizations of Dumas' text. The latter include part of
Franz's opium dream at the end of Chapter {\small XXXI},
some of the dialogue between Villefort and Madame Danglars in
Chapter {\small LXVII}, and several parts of
Chapter {\small XCVII}, on Eug\'enie and Louise's flight to
Belgium. In some cases the changes are so slight as to be quite hard to
detect. In the description of Eug\'enie at the opera
(Chapter {\small LIII}) for example, Dumas remarks that,
if one could reproach her with anything, it was that, both in her
upbringing and her appearance, `she seemed rather to belong to another
sex'. The English translator renders this: `As for her attainments, the
only fault to be found with them was \ldots{} that they were somewhat
too erudite and masculine for so young a person' (p. 542)! At the end of
Chapter {\small XCVII}, the translation (p. 950) simply
omits the few lines of dialogue where Dumas has Eug\'enie say that
`\emph{le rapt est bel et bien consomm\^e}' -- where the word \emph{rapt}
(`abduction') has a rather too overtly sexual connotation. Similarly,
earlier in the same chapter, where Eug\'enie jokes that anyone would think
she was `abducting' (\emph{enl\`eve}) Louise -- another word used almost
exclusively of a man with a woman -- the translator prefers the more
neutral phrase `carrying me off' and omits altogether Louise's remark
that Eug\'enie is `a real Amazon'. Another anonymous translation (Dent,
1894) refers to `the escape' rather than `the abduction' -- which makes
nonsense of Louise's reply that it is not a true abduction since it has
been accomplished without violence.

What may be more surprising than these concessions to the prudery of the
age is that the Victorian translators left in as much as they did. And
the omissions are by no means all to do with sexual matters. At the
start of Chapter {\small XXXIV}, for example, the
translator decides to spare us the description of the route taken
through Rome by Albert and Franz on their way to the Colosseum (though
the 1894 translator restores it). A whole paragraph analysing the
character of M. de Villefort at the start of
Chapter {\small XLVIII} is cut out; almost a whole page of
dialogue between Albert and Monte Cristo, on horses, in
Chapter {\small LXXXV} is cavalierly omitted (part was
restored by the translator of 1894); and so on. This is only a tiny
sample of what is, in reality, a vast number of phrases omitted, and
occasionally mistranslated.

What we see here, interestingly enough, is a stage in the process of
transforming Dumas' text into something simpler, less complex, less rich
in allusions, but more concentrated in plot and action. The 1846
translator already has an idea of what kind of novel this is, and that
dictates what he, or she, can afford to omit: travelogue, classical
references, sexual and psychological analysis, and so on. None of these
is essential to the plot of a thriller, and if some of them will
embarrass English readers, then why leave them in? The only problem is
that, nearly 150 years later, we do not have quite the same idea of what
is and what is not important. It was high time to go back to Dumas,
entire and unexpurgated.

As the basis for my translation, I have used the edition by Schopp,
quoted above, and the three-volume edition in the \emph{Livre de Poche}
(1973). Both of these use an arrangement of chapters which differs
slightly from that in the nineteenth-century English translations. I
have followed the \emph{Livre de Poche} in not changing Dumas' `errors'
of chronology etc. in the text as Schopp does; instead I have pointed
out the more important ones in the notes. I owe a debt to Schopp and to
Coward's edition in the World's Classics series for some of the
information in the notes.

On the broader question of translation, I have tried above all to
produce a version that is accurate and readable. A great deal of
nonsense is written about translation, particularly by academics who
approach it either as a terrain for theoretical debate or, worse still,
as a moral issue: `the translator must always be faithful to his
original,' Leonard Tancock wrote, oddly assuming that translation is a
masculine activity, even though on this occasion he was prefacing Nancy
Mitford's translation of \emph{La Princesse de Cl\`eves} (Penguin, 1978).
` \ldots{} he has no right whatever to take liberties with it \ldots{}
Nor has he any right to try to smooth the reader's path by the omission
of ``dull'' bits, short-circuitings, explanatory additions, radical
transferences or changes of order.' Why? And who says? Is it the reader
who is demanding this perfection, this absence of explanatory additions,
and so on?

Such academic theorists insist that a translation must read like a
translation -- it is somehow immoral to conceal the process that has
gone into making it. `Ordinary' readers usually demand the opposite, and
reviewers in quite respectable papers sometimes show little appreciation
of what the process means and involves: `Not all of this material works
in translation,' said one serious review of a book by Umberto Eco; and
another: ` \ldots{} the stories {[}of Viktoria Tokareva{]} are well
served by their translator, who hardly ever gets in the way'.

In philosophical terms I am quite willing to admit the impossibility of
translation, while still having in practical terms to engage in it and
to believe that everything must, to some extent, be translatable. I feel
no obligation to avoid smoothing the reader's path and none, on the
other hand, to `getting in the way' from time to time. Above all, I want
to convey some of the pleasure of reading Dumas to those who cannot do
so in the original language and, through my one, particular version
(since no translation can ever be definitive), to reveal aspects of his
work that are not to be found in any of the other existing versions.
This is a new translation and consequently a new interpretation of a
great -- and great popular -- novel. If nothing else, most people would
surely agree that it is long overdue.

\mychapter{Marseille -- Arrival}[first]

On February 24, 1815, the lookout at Notre-Dame de la Garde signalled
the arrival of the three-master \emph{Pharaon}, coming from Smyrna,
Trieste and Naples. As usual, a coastal pilot immediately left the port,
sailed hard by the Ch\^ateau d'If, and boarded the ship between the Cap de
Morgiou and the island of Riou.

At once (as was also customary) the terrace of Fort
Saint-Jean\textsuperscript{1} was thronged with
onlookers, because the arrival of a ship is always a great event in
Marseille, particularly when the vessel, like the \emph{Pharaon}, has
been built, fitted out and laded in the shipyards of the old port and
belongs to an owner from the town.

Meanwhile the ship was drawing near, and had successfully negotiated the
narrows created by some volcanic upheaval between the islands of
Calseraigne and Jarre; it had rounded Pom\`egue and was proceeding under
its three topsails, its outer jib and its spanker, but so slowly and
with such melancholy progress that the bystanders, instinctively sensing
some misfortune, wondered what accident could have occurred on board.
Nevertheless, those who were experts in nautical matters acknowledged
that, if there had been such an accident, it could not have affected the
vessel itself, for its progress gave every indication of a ship under
perfect control: the anchor was ready to drop and the bowsprit shrouds
loosed. Next to the pilot, who was preparing to guide the \emph{Pharaon}
through the narrow entrance to the port of Marseille, stood a young man,
alert and sharp-eyed, supervising every movement of the ship and
repeating each of the pilot's commands.

One of the spectators on the terrace of Fort Saint-Jean had been
particularly affected by the vague sense of unease that hovered among
them, so much so that he could not wait for the vessel to come to land;
he leapt into a small boat and ordered it to be rowed out to the
\emph{Pharaon}, coming alongside opposite the cove of La R\'eserve. When
he saw the man approaching, the young sailor left his place beside the
pilot and, hat in hand, came and leant on the bulwarks of the ship.

He was a young man of between eighteen and twenty, tall, slim, with fine
dark eyes and ebony-black hair. His whole demeanour possessed the calm
and resolve peculiar to men who have been accustomed from childhood to
wrestle with danger.

`Ah, it's you, Dant\`es!' the man in the boat cried. `What has happened,
and why is there this air of dejection about all on board?'

`A great misfortune, Monsieur Morrel!' the young man replied. `A great
misfortune, especially for me: while off Civita Vecchia, we lost our
good Captain Lecl\`ere.'

`And the cargo?' the ship owner asked brusquely.

`It has come safe to port, Monsieur Morrel, and I think you will be
content on that score. But poor Captain Lecl\`ere \ldots'

`What happened to him, then?' the shipowner asked, visibly relieved. `So
what happened to the good captain?'

`He is dead.'

`Lost overboard?'

`No, Monsieur, he died of an apoplectic fever, in terrible agony.' Then,
turning back to his crew, he said: `Look lively, there! Every man to his
station to drop anchor!'

The crew obeyed. As one man, the eight or ten sailors of which it was
composed leapt, some to the sheets, others to the braces, others to the
halyards, others to the jib, and still others to the brails. The young
sailor glanced casually at the start of this operation and, seeing that
his orders were being carried out, prepared to resume the conversation.

`But how did this misfortune occur?' the shipowner continued, picking it
up where the young man had left off.

`By heaven, Monsieur, in the most unexpected way imaginable: after a
long conversation with the commander of the port, Captain Lecl\`ere left
Naples in a state of great agitation. Twenty-four hours later, he was
seized with fever and, three days after that, he was dead \ldots{} We
gave him the customary funeral and he now rests, decently wrapped in a
hammock, with a thirty-six-pound cannonball at his feet and another at
his head, off the island of Giglio. We've brought his medal and his
sword back for his widow. Much good it did him,' the young man
continued, with a melancholy smile, `to fight the war against the
English for ten years -- only to die at last, like anyone else, in his
bed.'

`Dammit, Monsieur Edmond, what do you expect?' said the shipowner, who
appeared to be finding more and more to console him in his grief. `We
are all mortal. The old must give way to the young, or else there would
be no progress or promotion. As long as you can assure me that the cargo
\ldots'

`All is well with it, Monsieur Morrel, I guarantee you. If you take my
advice, you will not discount this trip for a profit of 25,000 francs.'

Then, as they had just sailed past the Round Tower, the young sailor
cried: `Furl the topmast sails, the jib and the spanker! Look lively!'

The order was obeyed with almost as much dispatch as on a man-o'-war.

`Let go and brail all!'

At this last command, all the sails were lowered and the progress of the
ship became almost imperceptible, driven only by the impetus of its
forward motion.

`And now, if you would like to come aboard, Monsieur Morrel,' Dant\`es
said, observing the owner's impatience, `I see your
supercargo,\textsuperscript{2} Monsieur Danglars,
coming out of his cabin. He will give you all the information that you
desire. As for me, I must see to the mooring and put the ship in
mourning.'

The owner did not need asking twice. He grasped hold of a line that
Dant\`es threw to him and, with an agility that would have done credit to
a seaman, climbed the rungs nailed to the bulging side of the ship,
while Dant\`es went back to his post and left the conversation to the man
he had introduced as Danglars: the latter was indeed emerging from his
cabin and coming across to the shipowner.

This new arrival was a man, twenty-five to twenty-six years old,
somewhat sombre in appearance, obsequious towards his superiors and
insolent to his subordinates; hence, even apart from the label of
supercargo, which always in itself causes aversion among sailors, he was
generally as much disliked by the crew as Dant\`es was loved by them.

`Well, Monsieur Morrel,' said Danglars, `you have heard the bad news, I
suppose?'

`Yes, yes, poor Captain Lecl\`ere! He was a fine and upright man!'

`And above all an excellent sailor, weathered between the sea and the
heavens, as was proper in a man responsible for looking after the
interests of so important a firm as Morrel and Son,' Danglars replied.

`Even so,' the shipowner replied, watching Dant\`es while he searched for
his mooring. `Even so, I think one need not be a seaman of such long
experience as you say, Danglars, to know the business: there is our
friend Edmond going about his, it seems to me, like a man who has no
need to ask advice of anybody.'

`Indeed,' said Danglars, casting a sidelong glance at Dant\`es with a
flash of hatred in his eyes. `Yes, indeed, he is young and full of
self-confidence. The captain was hardly dead before he had taken command
without asking anyone, and made us lose a day and a half on the island
of Elba, instead of returning directly to Marseille.'

`As far as taking command of the ship is concerned,' said the owner,
`that was his duty as first mate. As for losing a day and a half at
Elba, he was in the wrong, unless there was some damage to the ship that
needed repairing.'

`The ship was in as good shape as I am, and as good as I hope you are,
Monsieur Morrel. That day and a half was lost on a whim, for nothing
other than the pleasure of going ashore.'

`Dant\`es,' the owner said, turning towards the young man. `Would you come
here.'

`Your pardon, Monsieur,' Dant\`es said. `I shall be with you in an
instant.' Then, to the crew, he called: `Drop anchor!'

The anchor was immediately lowered and the chain ran out noisily. Dant\`es
stayed at his post, even though the pilot was there, until the last
operation had been carried out, then ordered: `Lower the pennant and the
flag to half-mast, unbrace the yards!'

`You see,' Danglars said. `I do believe he thinks himself captain
already.'

`So he is, in effect,' said the owner.

`Yes, apart from your signature and that of your partner, Monsieur
Morrel.'

`By gad, why shouldn't we leave him in the job?' said the owner. `He is
young, I grant you, but he seems made for it and very experienced in his
work.'

A cloud passed across Danglars' brow.

`Excuse me, Monsieur Morrel,' Dant\`es said as he came over. `Now that the
ship is moored, I am entirely at your disposal: I think you called me?'

Danglars took a step back.

`I wanted to ask why you stopped on the island of Elba.'

`I don't know, Monsieur. It was to carry out a last order from Captain
Lecl\`ere, who gave me, on his deathbed, a packet for Marshal
Bertrand.'\textsuperscript{3}

`Did you see him, Edmond?'

`Whom?'

`The Grand Marshal.'

`Yes.'

Morrel looked about him and drew Dant\`es aside.

`And how is the emperor?' he asked, earnestly.

`He is well, as far as I can judge by my own eyes.'

`So you saw the emperor, too, did you?'

`He came to visit the marshal while I was there.'

`And did you speak to him?'

`It was he, Monsieur, who spoke to me,' Dant\`es said, smiling.

`And what did he say?'

`He asked me about the ship, the time of its departure for Marseille,
the route it had taken and the cargo we were carrying. I think that, had
it been empty and I the master of it, he intended to buy it; but I told
him that I was only the first mate and that the ship belonged to the
firm of Morrel and Son. ``Ah, yes!'' he said. ``I know them. The Morrels
have been shipowners from father to son, and there was Morrel who served
in the same regiment as I did, when I was garrisoned at Valence.'' '

`By heaven, that's a fact!' the shipowner cried, with delight. `It was
Policar Morrel, my uncle, who later made captain. Dant\`es, tell my uncle
that the emperor remembered him, and you will bring tears to the old
trooper's eyes. Come, come, now,' he went on, putting a friendly arm
across the young man's shoulders, `you did well to follow Captain
Lecl\`ere's instructions and stop on Elba; even though, if it were known
that you gave a packet to the marshal and spoke to the emperor, you
might be compromised.'

`How could it compromise me, Monsieur?' said Dant\`es. `I don't even know
what I was carrying, and the emperor only asked me the same questions
that he would have put to anyone else. But please excuse me,' he
continued. `The health authorities and the Customs are coming on board.
With your permission?'

`Of course, of course, my dear Dant\`es, carry on.'

The young man went off and, as he did so, Danglars returned.

`So,' he asked, `it appears that he gave you good reason for stopping
off at Porto Ferrajo?'

`Excellent reason, my dear Danglars.'

`I am pleased to hear it,' the other replied. `It is always distressing
to see a comrade fail in his duty.'

`Dant\`es did his duty,' the shipowner answered, `and there is no more to
be said. It was Captain Lecl\`ere who ordered him to put into port.'

`Speaking of Captain Lecl\`ere, did he not give you a letter from him?'

`Who?'

`Dant\`es.'

`Not to me! Was there one?'

`I believe that, apart from the packet, Captain Lecl\`ere entrusted him
with a letter.'

`Which packet are you referring to, Danglars?'

`The same that Dant\`es delivered when we stopped at Porto Ferrajo.'

`And how did you know that he had a packet to deliver at Porto Ferrajo?'

Danglars blushed. `I was passing by the door of the captain's cabin,
which was partly open, and I saw him handing the packet and a letter to
Dant\`es.'

`He did not mention it,' said the owner. `But if he has such a letter,
he will give it to me.'

Danglars thought for a moment.

`In that case, Monsieur Morrel,' he said, `I beg you to say nothing
about it to Dant\`es. I must have been mistaken.'

At that moment the young man came back and Danglars left them.

`Now, my dear Dant\`es, are you free?' the owner asked.

`Yes, Monsieur.'

`It did not take long.'

`No, I gave the Customs a list of our cargo; as for the port
authorities, they sent a man with the coastal pilot, and I handed our
papers over to him.'

`So you have nothing more to do here?'

Dant\`es cast a rapid glance about him. `No, everything is in order,' he
said.

`Then you can come and take dinner with us?'

`Please, Monsieur Morrel, I beg you to excuse me, but the first thing I
must do is to visit my father. Nonetheless, I am most grateful for the
honour you do me.'

`That's proper, Dant\`es, very proper. I know that you are a good son.'

`And \ldots' Dant\`es asked, somewhat hesitantly, `as far as you know,
he's in good health, my father?'

`I do believe so, my dear Edmond, though I have not seen him.'

`Yes, he stays shut up in his little room.'

`Which at least proves that he lacked nothing while you were away.'

Dant\`es smiled.

`My father is a proud man, Monsieur, and even if he were short of
everything, I doubt if he would have asked for help from anyone in the
world, except God.'

`Now, when you have done that, we can count on your company.'

`I must beg you once more to excuse me, Monsieur Morrel, but after that
first visit, there is another that is no less important to me.'

`Ah, Dant\`es, that's true; I was forgetting that there is someone in Les
Catalans who must be expecting you with no less impatience than your
father -- the lovely Merc\'ed\`es.'

Dant\`es smiled.

`Ah, ha,' said the owner, `now I understand why she came three times to
ask me for news of the \emph{Pharaon}. Dash it, Edmond! You're a lucky
fellow, to have such a pretty mistress.'

`She is not my mistress, Monsieur,' the young sailor said gravely. `She
is my fianc\'ee.'

`It sometimes amounts to the same thing,' the owner said, with a
chuckle.

`Not for us, Monsieur,' Dant\`es replied.

`Come, come, my dear Edmond,' the other continued. `Don't let me detain
you. You have looked after my business well enough for me to give you
every opportunity to look after your own. Do you need any money?'

`No, Monsieur, I have all my salary from the trip -- that is, nearly
three months' pay.'

`You manage your affairs well, my boy.'

`You might add that my father is a poor man, Monsieur Morrel.'

`Yes, indeed, I know you are a good son to him. So: go and see your
father. I, too, have a son and I should bear a grudge against the man
who kept him away from me, after a three-month voyage.'

`May I take my leave, then?' the young man said, with a bow.

`Yes, if you have nothing more to say to me.'

`No.'

`When Captain Lecl\`ere was dying, he did not give you a letter for me?'

`It would have been impossible for him to write one, Monsieur. But that
reminds me: I wanted to ask you for a fortnight's leave.'

`To get married?'

`Firstly, then to go to Paris.'

`Very well! Have as much time as you want, Dant\`es. It will take us a
good six weeks to unload the vessel and we shall hardly be ready to put
to sea again within three months \ldots{} In three months' time,
however, you must be there. The \emph{Pharaon},' the shipowner
continued, putting a hand across the young sailor's shoulders, `cannot
set sail without its captain.'

`Without its captain!' Dant\`es cried, his eyes lighting up with joy. `Be
very careful what you are saying, Monsieur, because you have just
touched on the most secret of my heart's desires. Can it be that you
intend to appoint me captain of the \emph{Pharaon}?'

`If it was up to me alone, I should grasp your hand, my dear Dant\`es, and
say to you: ``the matter is settled!'' But I have a partner, and you
know the Italian proverb: \emph{chi ha compagno, ha
padrone}.\textsuperscript{4} But, at least, we
are half-way there, since you already have one of the two votes you
need. Leave it to me to get you the other, and I shall do my best.'

`Oh, Monsieur Morrel!' the young sailor cried, with tears in his eyes,
grasping the shipowner's hands. `Monsieur Morrel, I thank you, on behalf
of my father and of Merc\'ed\`es.'

`Fine, Edmond, fine! There is a God in heaven who looks after honest
folk. Go and see your father, go and see Merc\'ed\`es, then when that's
done, come and see me.'

`But don't you want me to accompany you back to land?'

`No, thank you. I shall stay here to settle my accounts with Danglars.
Were you happy with him during the voyage?'

`It depends on what you understand by that question, Monsieur. If you
mean, as a good companion, no, because I think that he has not liked me
since the day when I had the folly, after a trifling dispute between us,
to suggest that we should stop for ten minutes on the isle of Monte
Cristo to settle the matter. It was wrong of me to propose that, and he
was right to refuse. If you are asking me about him as a supercargo, I
think there is nothing to say, and that you will be satisfied with the
manner in which his duties have been carried out.'

`Come now, Dant\`es,' the shipowner asked, `if you were captain of the
\emph{Pharaon}, would you be pleased to keep Danglars?'

`Whether as captain or as first mate, Monsieur Morrel,' Dant\`es replied,
`I shall always have the highest regard for those who enjoy the
confidence of my owners.'

`Well, well, Dant\`es, you are clearly a fine lad, in every respect. Let
me detain you no longer, for I can see that you are on tenterhooks.'

`I may take my leave?' asked Dant\`es.

`Go on, I'm telling you.'

`Will you permit me to use your boat?'

`Take it.'

`Au revoir, Monsieur Morrel, and thank you a thousand times.'

`Au revoir, dear Edmond, and good luck!'

The young sailor leapt into the boat, seated himself in the stern and
gave the order to row across to the Canebi\`ere. Two sailors immediately
bent over their oars and the vessel proceeded as fast as it could, among
the thousand small boats that obstruct the sort of narrow alleyway
leading, between two lines of ships, from the harbour entrance to the
Quai d'Orl\'eans.

The shipowner looked after him, smiling, until the boat touched land and
he saw him leap on to the cobbled quay, where he was instantly lost in
the variegated crowd that, from five in the morning until nine in the
evening, throngs the famous street known as La Canebi\`ere: the modern
inhabitants of this old Phocean colony are so proud of it that they
proclaim, with all the seriousness in the world, in that accent which
gives such savour to everything they say: `If Paris had the Canebi\`ere,
Paris would be a little Marseille.'

Turning, the shipowner saw Danglars standing behind him, apparently
awaiting orders but in reality, like him, watching the young sailor's
departure. Yet there were very different expressions in these two pairs
of eyes following the one man.

\mychapter{Father and Son}

We shall leave Danglars, gripped by the demon of hatred, trying to
poison the shipowner's ear with some malicious libel against his
comrade, and follow Dant\`es who, after walking along the Canebi\`ere, took
the Rue de Noailles, entered a small house on the left side of the
All\'ees de Meilhan and hastened up the four flights of a dark stairway.
There, holding the banister with one hand, while the other repressed the
beating of his heart, he stopped before a half-open door through which
he could see to the back of a small room.

In this room lived Dant\`es' father.

News of the arrival of the \emph{Pharaon} had not yet reached the old
man who was standing on a chair, engaged with trembling hands in pinning
up some nasturtiums and clematis that climbed across the trellis outside
his window. Suddenly, he felt himself grasped around the waist and a
well-known voice exclaim behind him: `Father! My dear father!'

The old man cried out and turned around; then, seeing his son, fell into
his arms, pale and trembling.

`What is it, father?' the young man exclaimed, with concern. `Are you
unwell?'

`No, no, dear Edmond, my son, my child. No, but I was not expecting you
-- and the joy, the shock of seeing you like this, unexpectedly \ldots{}
Oh, heavens! It is too much for me!'

`Now, then, father, calm yourself! I am really here! They always say
that joy cannot harm you, which is why I came in without warning. Come
now, smile; don't look at me like that, with those wild eyes. I am back
and there is happiness in store for us.'

`I'm pleased to hear it, my boy,' the old man continued. `But what
happiness? Are you going to stay with me from now on? Come, tell me
about your good fortune!'

`God forgive me,' the young man said, `for rejoicing at good fortune
which has brought grief to the family of another. But, God knows, I
never wished for it; it has happened, and I do not have the heart to
grieve at it. Our good Captain Lecl\`ere is dead, father, and it seems
likely that, thanks to Monsieur Morrel's support, I shall have his
command. Do you understand, father? A captain at twenty! With a salary
of a hundred \emph{louis}\textsuperscript{1} and
a share in the profits! Isn't that better than a poor sailor like myself
could expect?'

`Yes, my son, yes,' said the old man. `This is indeed a stroke of luck.'

`So I want you to have a little house, with the first money I earn, and
a garden to grow your clematis, your nasturtiums and your honeysuckle
\ldots{} But what's wrong, father? You look ill!'

`An instant, don't worry! It is nothing.' And, his strength failing him,
he leant back.

`Father!' cried the young man. `Come, have a glass of wine; it will
revive you. Where do you keep your wine?'

`No, thank you, don't bother to look for it; there is no need,' he
replied, trying to restrain his son.

`Yes, indeed there is, father. Show me it.' He opened one or two
cupboards.

`It's a waste of time \ldots' the old man said. `There is no wine left.'

`What! No wine!' Dant\`es said, paling in turn as he looked from the old
man's sunken and livid cheeks to the empty cupboards. `What! You have no
wine left? Have you been short of money, father?'

`I am short of nothing, now that you are here,' said the old man.

`But I left you two hundred francs,' Dant\`es stammered, wiping the sweat
from his brow, `two months ago, as I was leaving.'

`Yes, yes, Edmond, so you did; but when you left you forgot a small debt
to my neighbour Caderousse. He reminded me of it and said that if I did
not settle it on your behalf, he would go and reclaim it from Monsieur
Morrel. So, you understand, I was afraid that it might do you some
harm.'

`And?'

`And I paid it.'

`But,' Dant\`es exclaimed, `I owed Caderousse a hundred and forty francs!'

`Yes,' the old man mumbled.

`And you paid them out of the two hundred francs that I left you?'

His father nodded.

`Which means that you lived for three months on sixty francs!' the young
man exclaimed.

`You know how small my needs are.'

`Oh, heaven, heaven, forgive me!' Edmond cried, falling on his knees in
front of the old man.

`What are you doing?'

`Ah! You have broken my heart!'

`Pah! You are here,' the old man said, with a smile. `All is forgotten,
because all is well.'

`Yes, here I am,' said the young man. `Here I am with a fine future and
a little money. Here, father,' he said, `take it, take it and send out
for something immediately.'

He emptied the contents of his pockets on the table: a dozen gold coins,
five or six five-franc pieces and some small change.

Old Dant\`es' face lit up.

`Whose is that?' he asked.

`Mine! Thine! Ours, of course! Take it, buy some food and enjoy
yourself. There will be more tomorrow.'

`Gently, gently,' the old man said, smiling. `If you don't mind, I shall
go easy on your money: if people see me buying too many things at once,
they will think that I had to wait for you to come back before I went
shopping.'

`Do as you think best, but first of all, father, get yourself a
housemaid: I don't want you to live on your own from now on. I have some
contraband coffee and some excellent tobacco in a little chest in the
hold. You will have it tomorrow. But, hush! Someone is coming.'

`That will be Caderousse, who has learned of your arrival and is no
doubt coming to welcome you back.'

`There's a fellow who says one thing and thinks another,' Edmond
muttered. `No matter. He is a neighbour who has helped us in the past,
so let him come in.'

Just as Edmond finished saying this under his breath, the black, bearded
head of Caderousse appeared on the landing, framed in the outer door. A
man of twenty-five or twenty-six years of age, he was holding a piece of
cloth which, being a tailor, he was about to fashion into the lining of
a jacket.

`You're back again, then, Edmond?' he said, with a thick Marseille
accent and a broad smile, revealing teeth as white as ivory.

`As you can see, neighbour, and entirely at your service,' Dant\`es
replied, this polite formula barely disguising his coldness towards the
man.

`Thank you, thank you. Fortunately, I need nothing; in fact, it is
sometimes others who need me.' Dant\`es bridled. `I am not saying that for
you, my boy. I lent you money and you returned it. That's how things are
done between good neighbours, and we're quits.'

`We are never quits towards those who have done us a favour,' said
Dant\`es. `Even when one ceases to owe them money, one owes them
gratitude.'

`There is no sense in speaking of that: what's past is past. Let's talk
about your happy return, young man. I just happened to go down to the
harbour to fetch some brown cloth, when I met our friend Danglars.
``You're in Marseille?'' I exclaimed. ``Yes, as you see.'' ``I thought
you were in Smyrna.'' ``It could well be, because I have just come back
from there.'' ``And where is young Edmond, then?'' ``At his father's, I
suppose,'' Danglars told me. So I came at once,' Caderousse concluded,
`to have the pleasure of shaking the hand of a friend.'

`Dear Caderousse,' the old man said. `He is so fond of us.'

`Indeed, I am, and I hold you in all the greater esteem, since honest
people are so rare! But it seems you have come into money, my boy?' the
tailor went on, glancing at the handful of gold and silver that Dant\`es
had emptied on to the table.

The young man observed a flash of greed light up his neighbour's dark
eyes. `Heavens, no!' he said casually. `That money is not mine. I was
just telling my father that I was afraid he might have wanted for
something while I was away and, to reassure me, he emptied his purse on
the table. Come, father,' he continued. `Put that money back in your
pocket -- unless, of course, our neighbour needs some for himself, in
which case it is at his disposal.'

`Indeed not, my boy,' said Caderousse. `I need nothing and, thank God,
my business holds body and soul together. Keep your money, keep it; one
can never have too much. Still, I am obliged for your offer, as much as
if I had taken advantage of it.'

`It was well meant,' said Dant\`es.

`I don't doubt that it was. So, I learn that you are on good terms with
Monsieur Morrel, sly one that you are?'

`Monsieur Morrel has always been very good to me,' Dant\`es answered.

`In that case, you were wrong to refuse dinner with him.'

`What do you mean: refuse dinner?' Old Dant\`es asked. `Did he invite you
to dinner?'

`Yes, father,' said Edmond, smiling at his father's astonishment on
learning of this high honour.

`So why did you refuse, son?' the old man asked.

`So that I could come straight back here, father,' the young man
answered. `I was anxious to see you.'

`He must have been put out by it, that good Monsieur Morrel,' Caderousse
remarked. `When one hopes to be made captain, it is a mistake to get on
the wrong side of one's owner.'

`I explained the reason for my refusal and I hope he understood it.'

`Even so, to be promoted to captain, one must flatter one's bosses a
little.'

`I expect to become captain without that,' Dant\`es retorted.

`So much the better! All your old friends will be pleased for you and I
know someone over there, behind the Citadelle de Saint-Nicholas, who
will not be unhappy about it, either.'

`Merc\'ed\`es?' the old man said.

`Yes, father,' Dant\`es resumed. `And, with your permission, now that I've
seen you, now that I know you are well and that you have all you need, I
would like to ask your leave to go and visit Les Catalans.'

`Go, child,' Old Dant\`es said. `And may God bless you as much in your
wife as He has blessed me in my son.'

`His wife!' said Caderousse. `Hold on, old man, hold on! As far as I
know, she's not that yet!'

`No,' Edmond replied, `but in all probability she soon will be.'

`Never mind,' said Caderousse, `never mind. You have done well to hurry
back, my boy.'

`Why?'

`Because Merc\'ed\`es is a beautiful girl, and beautiful girls are never
short of admirers, especially that one: there are dozens of them after
her.'

`Really?' Edmond said with a smile, not entirely concealing a hint of
unease.

`Oh, yes,' Caderousse continued, `and some with good prospects, too.
But, of course, you are going to be a captain, so she'll be sure not to
refuse you.'

`By which you mean,' Dant\`es said, smiling, but barely concealing his
anxiety, `that if I were not a captain \ldots'

`Ah! Ah!' said Caderousse.

`Come, now,' the young man said. `I have a better opinion than you of
women in general, and Merc\'ed\`es in particular, and I am persuaded that,
whether I were a captain or not, she would remain faithful to me.'

`So much the better! When one is going to get married, it is always a
good thing to have faith. But enough of that. Take my advice, lad: don't
waste any time in telling her of your return and letting her know about
your aspirations.'

`I am going at once,' said Edmond.

He embraced his father, nodded to Caderousse and left.

Caderousse stayed a moment longer, then, taking his leave of the elder
Dant\`es, followed the young man down and went to find Danglars who was
waiting for him on the corner of the Rue Senac.

`Well?' Danglars asked. `Did you see him?'

`I have just left them,' said Caderousse.

`And did he talk about his hope of being made captain?'

`He spoke of it as though he had already been appointed.'

`Patience!' Danglars said. `It seems to me that he is in rather too much
of a hurry.'

`Why, it seems Monsieur Morrel has given him his word.'

`So he is pleased?'

`He is even insolent about it. He has already offered me his services,
like some superior personage; he wanted to lend me money, like some
banker or other.'

`You refused?'

`Indeed I did, though I could well have accepted, since I am the one who
gave him the first silver coins he ever had in his hands. But now
Monsieur Dant\`es has no need of anyone: he is going to be a captain.'

`Huh!' said Danglars. `He's not one yet.'

`My God, it would be a fine thing indeed if he wasn't,' said Caderousse.
`Otherwise there will be no talking to him.'

`If we really want,' said Danglars, `he will stay as he is, and perhaps
even become less than he is.'

`What do you mean?'

`Nothing, I was talking to myself. Is he still in love with the
beautiful Catalan?'

`Madly. He has gone there now; but, unless I am gravely mistaken, he
will not find things altogether to his liking.'

`Explain.'

`What does it matter?'

`This is more important than you may think. You don't like Dant\`es, do
you?'

`I don't like arrogance.'

`Well, then: tell me what you know about the Catalan woman.'

`I have no positive proof, but I have seen things, as I said, that make
me think the future captain will not be pleased with what he finds
around the Chemin des Vieilles-Infirmeries.'

`What have you seen? Come on, tell me.'

`Well, I have observed that every time Merc\'ed\`es comes into town, she is
accompanied by a large Catalan lad, with black eyes, ruddy cheeks, very
dark in colour and very passionate, whom she calls ``my cousin''.'

`Ah, indeed! And do you think this cousin is courting her?'

`I imagine so: what else does a fine lad of twenty-one do to a pretty
girl of seventeen?'

`And you say that Dant\`es has gone to Les Catalans?'

`He left before me.'

`Suppose we were to go in the same direction, stop in the R\'eserve and,
over a glass of La Malgue wine, learn what we can learn.'

`Who would tell us anything?'

`We shall be on the spot and we'll see what has happened from Dant\`es'
face.'

`Let's go then,' said Caderousse. `But you are paying?'

`Certainly,' Danglars replied.

The two of them set off at a brisk pace for the spot they had mentioned
and, when they arrived, called for a bottle and two glasses.

Old Pamphile had seen Dant\`es go by less than two minutes before. Certain
that he was in Les Catalans, they sat under the budding leaves of the
plane-trees and sycamores, in the branches of which a happy band of
birds was serenading one of the first fine days of spring.

\mychapter{Les Catalans}

A hundred yards away from the place where the two friends, staring into
the distance with their ears pricked, were enjoying the sparkling wine
of La Malgue, lay the village of Les Catalans, behind a bare hillock
ravaged by the sun and the mistral.

One day, a mysterious group of colonists set out from Spain and landed
on this spit of land, where it still resides today. No one knew where
they had come from or what language they spoke. One of the leaders, who
understood Proven\c{c}al, asked the commune of Marseille to give them this
bare and arid promontory on to which, like the sailors of Antiquity,
they had drawn up their boats. The request was granted and, three months
later, a little village grew up around the twelve or fifteen boats that
brought these gypsies of the sea.

The same village, built in a bizarre and picturesque manner that is
partly Moorish and partly Spanish, is the one that can be seen today,
inhabited by the descendants of those men, who speak the language of
their forefathers. For three or four centuries they have remained
faithful to the little promontory on which they first landed, clinging
to it like a flock of seabirds, in no way mixing with the inhabitants of
Marseille, marrying among themselves and retaining the habits and dress
of their motherland, just as they have retained its tongue.

The reader must follow us along the only street of the little village
and enter one of those houses, to the outside of which the sunlight has
given that lovely colour of dead leaves which is peculiar to the
buildings of the country; with, inside, a coat of whitewash, the only
decoration of a Spanish \emph{posada}.

A lovely young girl with jet-black hair and the velvet eyes of a
gazelle, was standing, leaning against an inner wall, rubbing an
innocent sprig of heather between slender fingers like those on a
classical statue, and pulling off the flowers, the remains of which were
already strewn across the floor. At the same time, her arms, naked to
the elbow, arms that were tanned but otherwise seemed modelled on those
of the Venus of Arles, trembled with a sort of feverish impatience, and
she was tapping the ground with her supple, well-made foot, revealing a
leg that was shapely, bold and proud, but imprisoned in a red cotton
stocking patterned in grey and blue lozenges.

A short distance away, a tall young man of between twenty and twenty-two
was sitting on a chair, rocking it fitfully on two legs while supporting
himself on his elbow against an old worm-eaten dresser and watching her
with a look that combined anxiety with irritation. His eyes were
questioning, but those of the young woman, firm and unwavering,
dominated their conversation.

`Please, Merc\'ed\`es,' the man said. `Easter is coming round again; it's
the time for weddings. Give me your answer!'

`You have had it a hundred times, Fernand, and you really must like
torturing yourself, to ask me again.'

`Well, repeat it, I beg you, repeat it once more so that I can come to
believe it. Tell me, for the hundredth time, that you reject my love,
even though your mother approves of me. Convince me that you are
prepared to trifle with my happiness and that my life and my death are
nothing to you. My God, my God! To dream for ten years of being your
husband, Merc\'ed\`es, and then to lose that hope which was the sole aim of
my existence!'

`I, at least, never encouraged you in that hope, Fernand,' Merc\'ed\`es
replied. `You cannot accuse me of having, even once, flirted with you.
I've said repeatedly: ``I love you like a brother, but never demand
anything more from me than this fraternal love, because my heart belongs
to another.'' Isn't that what I have always told you, Fernand?'

`Yes, Merc\'ed\`es, I know,' the young man replied. `Yes, you have always
been laudably, and cruelly, honest with me. But are you forgetting that
it is a sacred law among the Catalans only to marry among themselves?'

`You are wrong, Fernand, it is not a law, but a custom, nothing more;
and I advise you not to appeal to that custom on your behalf. You have
been chosen for conscription, Fernand, and the freedom that you now
enjoy is merely a temporary reprieve: at any moment you might be called
up to serve in the army. Once you are a soldier, what will you do with
me -- I mean, with a poor orphan girl, sad and penniless, whose only
possession is a hut, almost in ruins, in which hang a few worn nets, the
paltry legacy that was left by my father to my mother, and by my mother
to me? Consider, Fernand, that in the year since she died, I have
virtually lived on charity! Sometimes you pretend that I am of some use
to you, so that you can be justified in sharing your catch with me. And
I accept, Fernand, because you are the son of one of my father's
brothers, because we grew up together and, beyond that, most of all,
because it would hurt you too much if I were to refuse. But I know full
well that the fish I take to the market, which bring me the money to buy
the hemp that I spin -- I know, full well, Fernand, that it is charity.'

`What does it matter, Merc\'ed\`es, poor and alone as you are, when you suit
me thus better than the daughter of the proudest shipowner or the
richest banker in Marseille? What do people like us need? An honest wife
and a good housekeeper. Where could I find better than you on either
score?'

`Fernand,' Merc\'ed\`es replied, shaking her head, `one is not a good
housekeeper and one cannot promise to remain an honest woman when one
loves a man other than one's husband. Be satisfied with my friendship
for, I repeat, that is all I can promise you and I only promise what I
am sure of being able to give.'

`Yes, I understand,' said Fernand. `You bear your own poverty patiently,
but you are afraid of mine. Well, Merc\'ed\`es, with your love, I would try
to make my fortune; you would bring me luck and I should become rich. I
can cast my fisherman's net wider, I can take a job as a clerk in a
shop, I could even become a merchant myself!'

`You can't do any such thing, Fernand: you're a soldier and, if you stay
here among the Catalans, it is because there is no war for you to fight.
So remain a fisherman, don't dream of things that will make reality seem
even more terrible to you -- and be content with my friendship, because
I cannot give you anything else.'

`You are right, Merc\'ed\`es, I shall be a seaman; and, instead of the dress
of our forefathers which you despise, I shall have a patent-leather hat,
a striped shirt and a blue jacket with anchors on the buttons. That's
how a man needs to dress, isn't it, if he wants to please you?'

`What do you mean?' Merc\'ed\`es asked, with an imperious look. `What do you
mean? I don't understand you.'

`What I mean, Merc\'ed\`es, is that you are only so hard-hearted and cruel
towards me because you are waiting for someone who is dressed like that.
But it may be that the one you await is fickle and, even if he isn't,
the sea will be fickle for him.'

`Fernand!' Merc\'ed\`es exclaimed. `I thought you were kind, but I was
mistaken. It is wicked of you to call on the wrath of God to satisfy
your jealousy. Yes, I will not deny it: I am waiting for the man you
describe, I love him and if he does not return, instead of blaming the
fickleness that it pleases you to speak of, I shall think that he died
loving me.'

The young Catalan made an angry gesture.

`I understand what that means, Fernand: you want to blame him because I
do not love you, and cross his dagger with your Catalan knife! What good
would that do you? If you were defeated, you would lose my friendship;
if you were the victor, you would see that friendship turn to hatred.
Believe me, when a woman loves a man, you do not win her heart by
crossing swords with him. No, Fernand, don't be carried away by evil
thoughts. Since you cannot have me as your wife, be content to have me
as a friend and a sister. In any case,' she added, her eyes anxious and
filling with tears, `stay, Fernand: you said, yourself, a moment ago
that the sea is treacherous. It is already four months since he left,
and I have counted a lot of storms in the past four months!'

Fernand remained impassive. He made no attempt to wipe the tears that
were running down Merc\'ed\`es cheeks, yet he would have given a glass of
his own blood for each of those tears; but they were shed for another.
He got up, walked round the hut and returned, stopping before Merc\'ed\`es
with a dark look in his eyes and clenched fists.

`Come now, Merc\'ed\`es,' he said. `Answer me once more: have you truly made
up your mind?'

`I love Edmond Dant\`es,' the young woman said, coldly, `and no one will
be my husband except Edmond.'

`And you will love him for ever?'

`As long as I live.'

Fernand bent his head like a discouraged man, gave a sigh that was like
a groan, then suddenly looked up with clenched teeth and nostrils
flared.

`But suppose he is dead?'

`If he is dead, I shall die.'

`And if he forgets you?'

`Merc\'ed\`es!' cried a happy voice outside the house. `Merc\'ed\`es!'

`Ah!' the girl exclaimed, reddening with joy and leaping up, filled with
love. `You see that he has not forgotten me: he is here!' And she ran to
the door, and opened it, crying: `Come to me, Edmond! I am here!'

Pale and trembling, Fernand stepped back as a traveller might do at the
sight of a snake; and, stumbling against his chair, fell back into it.

Edmond and Merc\'ed\`es were in each other's arms. The hot Marseille sun,
shining through the doorway, drenched them in a flood of light. At
first, they saw nothing of what was around them. A vast wave of
happiness cut them off from the world and they spoke only those
half-formed words that are the outpourings of such intense joy that they
resemble the expression of pain.

Suddenly, Edmond noticed the sombre figure of Fernand, pale and
threatening in the darkness. With a gesture of which he was not even
himself aware, the young Catalan had laid his hand on the knife at his
belt.

`Oh, forgive me,' Dant\`es said, raising an eyebrow. `I did not realize
that we were not alone.'

Then, turning to Merc\'ed\`es, he asked: `Who is this gentleman?'

`He will be your best friend, Dant\`es, because he is my friend, my cousin
and my brother: this is Fernand, which means he is the man whom, after
you, I love most in the world. Don't you recognize him?'

`Ah! Yes, indeed,' said Edmond. And, without leaving Merc\'ed\`es whose hand
he held clasped in one of his own, he extended the other with a cordial
gesture towards the Catalan. But Fernand, instead of responding to this
sign of friendship, remained as silent and motionless as a statue. It
was enough to make Edmond look enquiringly from Merc\'ed\`es, who was
trembling with emotion, to Fernand, sombre and threatening.

That one glance told him everything. His brow clouded with rage.

`I did not realize that I had hurried round to see you, Merc\'ed\`es, only
to find an enemy here.'

`An enemy!' Merc\'ed\`es exclaimed, looking angrily in the direction of her
cousin. `An enemy, in my house, you say, Edmond! If I thought that, I
should take your arm and go with you to Marseille, leaving this house,
never to return.'

Fernand's eyes lit up with rage.

`And if any misfortune were to befall you, my dear Edmond,' she
continued, with the same cool determination, proving to Fernand that she
had read the sinister depths of his mind, `if any misfortune should
happen to you, I should climb up the Cap de Morgiou and throw myself
headlong on to the rocks.'

The blood drained from Fernand's face.

`But you are wrong, Edmond,' she continued. `You have no enemies here.
The only person here is Fernand, my brother, who is going to shake your
hand like a true friend.'

With these words, the girl turned her imperious face towards the Catalan
and he, as if mesmerized by her look, slowly came across to Edmond and
held out his hand. His hatred, like an impotent wave, had been broken
against the ascendancy that the woman exercised over him. But no sooner
had he touched Edmond's hand than he felt he had done all that it was
possible for him to do, and rushed out of the house.

`Ah!' he cried, running along like a madman and burying his hands in his
hair. `Ah! Who will deliver me from this man? Wretch that I am, wretch
that I am!'

`Hey, Catalan! Hey, Fernand! Where are you going?' a voice called to
him.

The young man stopped dead, looked around and saw Caderousse at the
table with Danglars under a leafy arbour.

`What now,' said Caderousse, `why don't you join us? Are you in such a
hurry that you don't have time to say hello to your friends?'

`Especially when they still have an almost full bottle in front of
them,' Danglars added.

Fernand stared at the two men with a dazed look, and did not answer.

`He seems a bit down in the dumps,' Danglars said, nudging Caderousse
with his knee. `Could we be wrong? Contrary to what we thought, could it
be that Dant\`es has got the upper hand?'

`Why! We'll just have to find out,' said Caderousse. And, turning back
to the young man, he said: `Well, Catalan, have you made up your mind?'

Fernand wiped the sweat from his brow and slowly made his way under the
vault of leaves: its shade appeared to do something to calm his spirits
and its coolness to bring a small measure of well-being back to his
exhausted body.

`Good day,' he said. `I think you called me?'

`I called you because you were running along like a madman and I was
afraid you would go and throw yourself into the sea,' Caderousse said
with a laugh. `Devil take it, when one has friends, it is not only to
offer them a glass of wine, but also to stop them drinking three or four
pints of water.'

Fernand gave a groan that resembled a sob and let his head fall on to
his wrists, which were crossed on the table.

`Well now, do you want me to tell you what, Fernand?' Caderousse
continued, coming straight to the point with that crude brutality of the
common man whose curiosity makes him forget any sense of tact. `You look
to me like a man who has been crossed in love!' He accompanied this quip
with a roar of laughter.

`Huh!' Danglars retorted. `A lad built like that is not likely to be
unhappy in love. You must be joking, Caderousse.'

`Not at all,' the other said. `Just listen to him sigh. Come, Fernand,
come now, lift your nose off the table and tell us: it is not very
mannerly to refuse to answer your friends when they are asking after
your health.'

`My health is fine,' said Fernand, clenching his fists and without
looking up.

`Ah, Danglars, you see now,' Caderousse said, winking at his friend.
`This is how things are: Fernand here, who is a fine, brave Catalan, one
of the best fishermen in Marseille, is in love with a beautiful girl
called Merc\'ed\`es; but it appears that, unfortunately, the girl herself is
in love with the second mate of the \emph{Pharaon}; and, as the
\emph{Pharaon} came into port this very day \ldots{} You follow me?'

`No, I don't,' said Danglars.

`Poor Fernand has got his marching orders,' Caderousse continued.

`So, what then?' said Fernand, lifting his head and looking at
Caderousse, like a man anxious to find someone on whom to vent his
wrath. `Merc\'ed\`es is her own woman, isn't she? She is free to love
whomsoever she wants.'

`Oh, if that's how you take it,' said Caderousse, `that's another
matter. I thought you were a Catalan, and I have been told that the
Catalans are not men to let themselves be pushed aside by a rival. They
even said that Fernand, in particular, was fearsome in his vengeance.'

Fernand smiled pityingly. `A lover is never fearsome,' he said.

`Poor boy!' Danglars continued, pretending to grieve for the young man
from the bottom of his heart. `What do you expect? He didn't imagine
that Dant\`es would suddenly return like this; he may have thought him
dead, or unfaithful. Who knows? Such things are all the more distressing
when they happen to us suddenly.'

`In any event,' Caderousse said, drinking as he spoke and starting to
show the effects of the heady wine of La Malgue, `in any event, Fernand
is not the only person to have been put out by Dant\`es' fortunate return,
is he, Danglars?'

`No, what you say is true -- and I might even add that it will bring him
misfortune.'

`No matter,' Caderousse went on, pouring out some wine for Fernand and
replenishing his own glass for the eighth or tenth time (though Danglars
had hardly touched the one in front of him). `No matter. In the meantime
he will marry Merc\'ed\`es, the lovely Merc\'ed\`es. He has come back for that,
at least.'

While the other was speaking, Danglars directed a piercing look at the
young man, on whose heart Caderousse's words were falling like molten
lead.

`And when is the wedding?' he asked.

`Oh, it's not settled yet,' Fernand muttered.

`No, but it will be,' said Caderousse, `just as surely as Dant\`es will be
captain of the \emph{Pharaon}, don't you think, Danglars?'

Danglars shuddered at this unexpected stab and turned towards
Caderousse, studying his face now to see if the blow had been
premeditated; but he saw nothing except covetousness on this face,
already almost besotted with drink.

`Very well,' he said, filling the glasses. `Then let's drink to Captain
Edmond Dant\`es, husband of the beautiful Catalan!'

Caderousse lifted his glass to his lips with a sluggish hand and drained
it in one gulp. Fernand took his and dashed it to the ground.

`Ha, ha!' said Caderousse. `What can I see over there, on the crest of
the hill, coming from the Catalan village? You look, Fernand, your
eyesight is better than mine. I think I'm starting to see less clearly
and, as you know, wine is a deceptive imp: it looks to me like two
lovers walking along, side by side and hand in hand. Heaven forgive me!
They don't realize that we can see them and, look at that, they're
kissing each other!'

Danglars marked every single trait of the anguish that crossed Fernand's
face, as its features changed before his eyes.

`Do you know who they are, Monsieur Fernand?' he asked.

`Yes,' the other replied dully. `It's Monsieur Edmond and Mademoiselle
Merc\'ed\`es.'

`There! You see?' said Caderousse. `I didn't recognize them. Hey,
Dant\`es! Hey, there, pretty girl! Come down for a moment and let us know
when the wedding is: Fernand here is so stubborn, he won't tell us.'

`Why don't you be quiet!' said Danglars, pretending to restrain
Caderousse who, with drunken obstinacy, was leaning out of the arbour.
`Try to stay upright and let the lovers enjoy themselves in peace. Why,
look at Monsieur Fernand: he's being sensible. Why not try and do the
same?'

It may be that Fernand, driven to the limit and baited by Danglars like
a bull by the banderilleros, would finally have leapt forward, for he
had already stood up and appeared to be gathering strength to throw
himself at his rival; but Merc\'ed\`es, upright and laughing, threw back her
lovely head and shot a glance from her clear eyes. At that moment,
Fernand recalled her threat to die if Edmond should die, and slumped
back, discouraged, on his chair.

Danglars looked at the two men, one besotted by drink, the other
enslaved by love, and murmured: `I shall get nothing out of these
idiots: I fear I am sitting between a drunkard and a coward. On the one
hand, I have a man eaten up by envy, drowning his sorrows in drink when
he should be intoxicated with venom; on the other, a great simpleton
whose mistress has just been snatched away from under his very nose, who
does nothing except weep like a child and feel sorry for himself. And
yet he has the blazing eyes of a Spaniard, a Sicilian or a Calabrian --
those people who are such experts when it comes to revenge -- and fists
that would crush a bull's head as surely as a butcher's mallet. Fate is
definitely on Edmond's side: he will marry the beautiful girl, become
captain and laugh in our faces. Unless \ldots' (a pallid smile hovered
on Danglars' lips) ` \ldots{} unless I take a hand in it.'

Caderousse, half standing, with his fists on the table, was still
shouting: `Hello, there! Hello! Edmond! Can't you see your friends, or
are you too proud to talk to them?'

`No, my dear Caderousse,' Edmond replied. `I am not proud, but I am
happy -- and happiness, I believe, is even more dazzling than pride.'

`At last, all is explained,' said Caderousse. `Ho! Good day to you,
Madame Dant\`es.'

Merc\'ed\`es bowed gravely and said: `That is not yet my name, and in my
country they say it is bad luck to call a young woman by the name of her
betrothed before he has become her husband. So, please, call me
Merc\'ed\`es.'

`You must forgive my good neighbour, Caderousse,' Dant\`es said. `He so
seldom makes a mistake!'

`So, the wedding is to take place shortly, Monsieur Dant\`es?' Danglars
said, greeting the two young people.

`As soon as possible, Monsieur Danglars. Today, everything is to be
agreed at my father's house and tomorrow or, at the latest, the day
after, we shall have the engagement dinner here at La R\'eserve. I hope
that my friends will join us: you, of course, are invited, Monsieur
Danglars, and you, too, Caderousse.'

`And Fernand?' Caderousse asked, with a coarse laugh. `Will Fernand be
there as well?'

`My wife's brother is my brother,' Edmond said, `and both Merc\'ed\`es and I
should regret it deeply if he were to be separated from us at such a
time.'

Fernand opened his mouth to reply, but his voice caught in his throat
and he could not utter a single word.

`The agreement today, the engagement tomorrow or the day after: by
George! You're in a great hurry, Captain.'

`Danglars,' Edmond said with a smile, `I shall say the same to you as
Merc\'ed\`es did a moment ago: don't give me a title that does not yet
belong to me, it could bring me ill luck.'

`My apologies,' Danglars replied. `I was merely saying that you seem in
a great hurry. After all, we have plenty of time: the \emph{Pharaon}
will not set sail for a good three months.'

`One always hurries towards happiness, Monsieur Danglars, because when
one has suffered much, one is at pains to believe in it. But I am not
impelled by mere selfishness. I have to go to Paris.'

`Ah, indeed! To Paris. And will this be your first visit, Dant\`es?'

`Yes.'

`You have business there?'

`Not of my own, but a final request that I must carry out for our poor
Captain Lecl\`ere. You understand, Danglars, the mission is sacred to me.
In any event, don't worry. I shall be gone only as long as it takes to
go there and return.'

`Yes, yes, I understand,' Danglars said aloud; then he added, under his
breath: `To Paris, no doubt to deliver the letter that the marshal gave
him. By heaven! That letter has given me an idea -- an excellent idea!
Ah, Dant\`es, my friend, your name is not yet Number One on the register
of the \emph{Pharaon}.'

Then, turning back to Edmond who was leaving, he shouted: `\emph{Bon
voyage!}'

`Thank you,' Edmond replied, turning around and giving a friendly wave.
Then the two lovers went on their way, calm and happy as two chosen
souls heading for paradise.

\mychapter{The Plot}

Danglars' eyes followed Edmond and Merc\'ed\`es until the two lovers had
vanished round one corner of the Fort Saint-Nicholas; then, turning at
last, he noticed Fernand who had slipped back on to his chair, pale and
trembling, while Caderousse was mumbling the words of a drinking song.

`So, my good sir,' Danglars told Fernand, `not everyone, I think, is
happy about this marriage.'

`I am in despair,' said Fernand.

`You're in love with Merc\'ed\`es?'

`I adore her!'

`For a long time?'

`Ever since I've known her; I've always loved her.'

`And all you can do is sit there and tear your hair out, instead of
finding some way out of the dilemma! By God! I didn't know that this was
how people of your country behaved.'

`What do you expect me to do?' Fernand asked.

`How do I know? Is it any of my business? As I see it, I'm not the one
who's in love with Mademoiselle Merc\'ed\`es; you are. Seek and ye shall
find, the Gospel says.'

`I had found already.'

`What?'

`I wanted to put my knife into the creature, but the girl said that if
her fianc\'e was harmed, she would kill herself.'

`Pah! People say such things, but they don't do them.'

`You don't know Merc\'ed\`es, Monsieur. If she threatens to do something,
she will.'

`Idiot!' Danglars muttered. `What does it matter whether she kills
herself or not, provided Dant\`es does not become captain.'

`And before Merc\'ed\`es dies,' Fernand went on, in firmly resolute tones,
`I should die myself.'

`There's love for you!' Caderousse said, in a voice increasingly slurred
by drink. `There's love, or I don't know it.'

`Come now,' said Danglars. `You seem an agreeable enough lad to me and
-- by Jove! -- I'd like to ease your sorrow, but \ldots'

`Yes,' said Caderousse. `Come now.'

`My good friend,' Danglars remarked, `you are three-quarters drunk: go
the whole way and finish the bottle. Drink, but don't interfere with our
business, because you need a clear head for what we're doing.'

`Me? Drunk?' said Caderousse. `Never! I could take another four of your
bottles, which are no bigger than bottles of eau de Cologne. P\`ere
Pamphile! Bring us some wine!'

And, to make the point, Caderousse banged his glass on the table.

`You were saying, Monsieur?' Fernand asked, impatient to hear what else
Danglars had to tell him.

`What was I saying? I don't remember. This drunkard Caderousse has put
it quite out of my mind.'

`Drunkard if you like. A curse on those who fear wine: it's because they
have evil thoughts and they are afraid that wine will loosen their
tongues.'

Caderousse began to sing the last two lines of a song which was much in
vogue at the time:

\begin{quote}
\small
The Flood proved it beyond a doubt:\\
All wicked men do water drink.\textsuperscript{1}
\end{quote}

`You were saying, Monsieur,' Fernand continued, `that you'd like to ease
my sorrow, but you added \ldots'

`Ah, yes. But I added that \ldots{} to give you satisfaction, it is
enough for Dant\`es not to marry the one you love. And this marriage, it
seems to me, could very well not take place, even if Dant\`es does not
die.'

`Only death will separate them,' said Fernand.

`You have the brains of an oyster, my friend,' said Caderousse. `And
Danglars here, who is a sharp one, crafty as a Greek, will prove you
wrong. Do it, Danglars. I've stuck up for you. Tell him that Dant\`es
doesn't have to die. In any case, it would be a pity if he died. He's a
good lad, Dant\`es. I like him. Your health, Dant\`es.'

Fernand rose impatiently to his feet.

`Let him babble,' Danglars said, putting a hand on the young man's arm.
`And, for that matter, drunk as he is, he is not so far wrong. Absence
separates as effectively as death; so just suppose that there were the
walls of a prison between Edmond and Merc\'ed\`es: that would separate them
no more nor less than a tombstone.'

`Yes, but people get out of prison,' said Caderousse, who was gripping
on to the conversation with what remained of his wits. `And when you get
out of prison and you are called Edmond Dant\`es, you take revenge.'

`What does that matter!' said Fernand.

`In any event,' Caderousse continued, `why should they put Dant\`es in
prison? He hasn't stolen anything, killed anyone, committed any murder.'

`Shut up,' said Danglars.

`I don't want to shut up,' said Caderousse. `I want to know why they
should put Dant\`es in prison. I like Dant\`es. Dant\`es! Your health!'

He poured back another glass of wine.

Danglars assessed the extent of the tailor's drunkenness from his dull
eyes, and turned towards Fernand.

`So, do you understand that there is no need to kill him?' he said.

`No, surely not if, as you said a moment ago, there was some means of
having Dant\`es arrested. But do you have such a means?'

`If we look,' Danglars answered, `we can find one. But, dammit, why
should this concern me? What business is it of mine?'

`I don't know why it should concern you,' Fernand said, grasping his
arm. `What I do know is that you have some private animosity against
Dant\`es: a man who feels hated cannot be mistaken about that feeling in
others.'

`I? Have some reason to hate Dant\`es? None, I swear. I saw that you were
unhappy and took an interest in your unhappiness, that's all. But if you
are going to imagine that I am acting on my own behalf, then farewell,
my good friend. You can manage for yourself.' Here Danglars himself made
as if to get up.

`No, stay!' said Fernand. `When it comes down to it, it's of no matter
to me whether you have some bone to pick with Dant\`es or not; I do, and I
freely admit it. Find the means and I shall carry it out, as long as
there is no murder involved, for Merc\'ed\`es said that she would kill
herself if anyone killed Dant\`es.'

Caderousse, who had let his head fall on the table, lifted it and turned
his dull, drink-sodden eyes on Fernand and Danglars.

`Kill Dant\`es!' he said. `Who's talking about killing Dant\`es? I don't
want him killed. He's my friend. This morning, he offered to share his
money with me, as I shared mine with him. I don't want anyone to kill
Dant\`es.'

`Who said anything about killing him, idiot?' Danglars went on. `It's
nothing more than a joke. Drink to his health and leave us be,' he
added, filling Caderousse's glass.

`Yes, yes. To Dant\`es' health,' said Caderousse, emptying his glass. `His
health! His health! Like that!'

`But the means, what about the means?' Fernand asked.

`You haven't thought of any yet?'

`No, you said that you would do that.'

`That's true,' said Danglars. `A Spaniard is inferior to a Frenchman in
one respect: your Spaniard thinks things over, but your Frenchman thinks
them up.'

`Well, think up something, then,' Fernand said impatiently.

`Waiter!' Danglars called. `A pen, ink and paper!'

`A pen, ink and paper,' Fernand muttered.

`Yes, I am an accountant: pens, ink and paper are the tools of my trade,
and without them I can do nothing.'

`A pen, some ink and some paper!' Fernand repeated to the waiter.

`What you need is over there on the table,' the waiter said, indicating
the items they had requested.

`Give them to us, then.'

The waiter brought the paper, some ink and a quill pen, and put them on
the table in the arbour.

`When you think,' Caderousse said, letting his hand fall on to the
paper, `that what you have here can kill a man more surely than if you
were to hide in the woods to murder him! I have always been more afraid
of a pen, a bottle of ink and a sheet of paper than of a sword or a
pistol.'

`This clown is not yet as drunk as he seems,' said Danglars. `Pour him
another drink, Fernand.'

Fernand filled Caderousse's glass and he, like the true drunkard he was,
took his hand off the paper and moved it to his glass. The Catalan
watched him until Caderousse, almost floored by this new assault, put
his glass back -- or, rather, let it fall -- on to the table.

`Well?' the Catalan asked, seeing that the last traces of Caderousse's
wits had begun to disappear in this final draught of wine.

`As I was saying,' Danglars continued, `for example, after a voyage such
as the one Dant\`es has just made, in the course of which he put in at
Naples and the island of Elba, if someone were to denounce him to the
crown prosecutor\textsuperscript{2} as a
Bonapartist agent \ldots'

`I'll denounce him, I'll do it!' the young man said eagerly.

`Yes, but in that case you would have to sign your declaration and be
confronted with the man you accused: I could give you proof to support
your accusation, I know; but Dant\`es cannot stay in prison for ever; one
day he will come out, and on that day, woe betide the one who put him
there!'

`Oh, I couldn't ask for anything better,' said Fernand. `Let him come
and challenge me.'

`Yes, but what about Merc\'ed\`es? Merc\'ed\`es who will hate you if you are
unfortunate enough to leave even a scratch on her beloved Edmond!'

`That's true,' said Fernand.

`No, no,' Danglars continued. `You see, if we were to make up our minds
to such a thing, it would be far better simply to do as I am doing now,
and take this pen, dip it in the ink and, with one's left hand -- to
disguise the writing -- make out a little denunciation in these terms.'

To illustrate his meaning, Danglars wrote the following lines, with his
left hand, the writing sloping backwards so that it bore no resemblance
to his usual handwriting, then passed it to Fernand, who read it in a
hushed voice:

\begin{quote}
\small
The crown prosecutor is advised, by a friend of the monarchy and the
faith, that one Edmond Dant\`es, first mate of the \emph{Pharaon},
arriving this morning from Smyrna, after putting in at Naples and Porto
Ferrajo, was entrusted by
Murat\textsuperscript{3} with a letter for the
usurper and by the usurper with a letter to the Bonapartist committee in
Paris.

Proof of his guilt will be found when he is arrested, since the letter
will be discovered either on his person, or at the house of his father,
or in his cabin on board the \emph{Pharaon}.
\end{quote}

`So there we have it,' Danglars continued. `In this way your revenge
would be consistent with common sense, because it could in no way be
traced back to you and the matter would proceed of its own accord. You
would merely have to fold the letter -- as I am doing now -- and write
on it: ``To the Crown Prosecutor''. That would settle it.' And Danglars
wrote the address with a simple stroke of the pen.

`Yes, that would settle it,' cried Caderousse, who had made one final
effort to muster his wits and follow the reading of the letter, and
understood instinctively all the misfortune that such a denunciation
could bring. `Yes, that would settle it, except that it would be a vile
act.' And he reached over to take the letter.

`Which is why,' said Danglars, pushing it beyond the reach of his hand,
`which is why what I am saying and doing is simply in jest; and I should
be the first to be upset if anything were to happen to Dant\`es -- dear
Dant\`es! So, watch \ldots'

He took the letter, crumpled it in his hands and threw it into a corner
of the arbour.

`That's right,' said Caderousse. `Dant\`es is my friend and I don't want
anyone to harm him.'

`The devil take it! Whoever would think of doing him harm? Certainly not
I or Fernand!' said Danglars, getting up and looking at the young man,
who had remained seated but who had his covetous eye fixed sideways on
the accusing letter where it had fallen.

`In that case,' Caderousse went on, `bring us more wine: I want to drink
to the health of Edmond and the lovely Merc\'ed\`es.'

`You have had enough to drink already, you tippler,' said Danglars. `If
you go on, you will have to sleep here, because you won't be able to
stand up.'

`Me?' said Caderousse, rising with the ridiculous movement of a drunken
man. `Me! Not be able to stand up! I wager I could go up the belfry of
Les Accoules, and without wavering.'

`Well, if you wish,' said Danglars. `I accept the wager, but for
tomorrow. Today it is time to go home, so give me your arm and we'll get
started.'

`Let's go,' said Caderousse, `but I don't need your arm for it. Are you
coming, Fernand? Come with us to Marseille.'

`No,' said Fernand. `I'm going back to Les Catalans.'

`Don't be silly. Come with us to Marseille. Come on.'

`I have no business in Marseille and I don't want to go there.'

`What did you say? You don't want to, my lad! Well, do as you wish.
Everyone can do as he wishes. Come on, Danglars, and let this gentleman
go back to the Catalans, since that's what he wants.'

Danglars took advantage of Caderousse's momentary amenability to drag
him towards Marseille; but, to leave a shorter and easier way free for
Fernand, instead of going back via the Quai de la Rive-Neuve, he went
through the Porte Saint-Victor. Caderousse followed, swaying and
gripping his arm.

When he had gone some twenty yards, Danglars turned around and saw
Fernand grab the piece of paper and put it in his pocket. Then, running
out of the arbour, the young man immediately went in the direction of Le
Pillon.

`There, now! What's he up to?' said Caderousse. `He lied to us. He said
he was going to Les Catalans, and he's headed into town. Hey, Fernand,
my boy! You're going the wrong way!'

`It's you who can't see properly,' said Danglars. `He has gone straight
down the road to the Vieilles-Infirmeries.'

`Has he?' said Caderousse. `Well, now, I could have sworn that he turned
to the right. Wine really is a deceiver.'

`Come on, come on,' Danglars muttered. `I think that the matter is
properly under way now, and all we have to do is to let it take its
course.'

\mychapter{The Betrothal}

The next day, the weather was fine. The sun rose, brilliant and clear,
and its first purple rays glistened like rubies on the foamy crests of
the waves.

The meal had been set out on the first floor of the same inn, La
R\'eserve, with the terrace of which we are already acquainted. It was a
large room, lit by five or six windows, above each of which (for some
inexplicable reason) was inscribed the name of one of the great towns of
France. A gallery -- of wood, like the rest of the building -- ran the
whole length of the room under the windows.

Although the meal was due to begin only at noon, this gallery was
crowded with impatient onlookers from eleven o'clock in the morning.
These were a few chosen sailors from the \emph{Pharaon} and some
soldiers who were Dant\`es' friends. All of them were in their Sunday
best, in honour of the engaged couple.

The rumour circulating among these expectant guests was that the owners
of the \emph{Pharaon} were to honour its first mate's betrothal feast
with their presence, but this would have been to do such a great honour
to Dant\`es that no one yet dared believe it. However, Danglars, when he
arrived with Caderousse, confirmed the news: he had seen M. Morrel
himself, that morning, and M. Morrel had said that he would be dining at
La R\'eserve.

Indeed, a moment later, M. Morrel made his entrance into the room and
was saluted by the crew of the \emph{Pharaon} with a unanimous burst of
applause and shouts of `Hurrah!' The owner's presence was seen by them
as confirmation of a rumour, already going about, that Dant\`es was to be
appointed captain; and, since Dant\`es was much liked on board, the men
took this way of thanking the owner because, for once, his choice was
concordant with their wishes. Hardly had M. Morrel entered than Danglars
and Caderousse were, by general agreement, dispatched to find the
fianc\'e, with orders to advise him of the arrival of this important
person whose appearance had caused such a stir, and to tell him to
hurry.

Danglars and Caderousse set off at full speed, but had hardly gone any
distance before they saw the little band approaching, just coming past
the powder magazine. It was made up of four young women, friends of
Merc\'ed\`es and Catalans like her, who were accompanying the fianc\'ee while
Edmond gave her his arm. Next to her walked Old Dant\`es and behind them
came Fernand, with his sour smile.

Neither Merc\'ed\`es nor Edmond could see the smile on Fernand's face. The
poor children were so happy that they saw nothing except one another and
the pure, clear sky that showered its blessing on them.

Danglars and Caderousse discharged their diplomatic mission, then
exchanged a warm and energetic handshake with Edmond, and took up their
places, Danglars next to Fernand and Caderousse beside Old Dant\`es, who
was the general centre of attention.

The old man was wearing his fine coat of fluted taffeta, decorated with
large-faceted steel buttons. His lanky but vigorous legs were clothed in
a splendid pair of spotted stockings that cried out English contraband.
A mass of white and blue ribbons hung from his three-cornered hat.
Finally, he was supported by a stick of twisted wood, bent at the top
like a classical staff or \emph{pedum}. He looked like one of those
dandies who used to parade in 1796 in the newly re-opened gardens of the
Luxembourg or the Tuileries.

As we said, Caderousse had slipped into step beside him -- Caderousse,
entirely reconciled with the Dant\`es by the prospect of a good meal,
Caderousse whose mind retained some vague memory of what had happened
the previous day, as one's brain on waking in the morning may hold a
shadow of the dream that it experienced in sleep.

As he came up to Fernand, Danglars searched deep into the disappointed
lover's soul. He was walking behind the engaged couple, entirely
forgotten by Merc\'ed\`es, who, with the childlike and endearing egoism of
love, had eyes only for her Edmond. Fernand was pale, then his colour
would heighten suddenly, only to give way again to a deepening pallor.
From time to time he looked towards Marseille, and an involuntary
nervous tremor would shake his limbs. He seemed to be expecting, or at
least to anticipate the possibility of, some important event.

Dant\`es was dressed simply. Since he belonged to the merchant marine, his
clothes were halfway between military uniform and civilian dress; in
this habit, his evident good health, set off against the happiness and
beauty of his fianc\'ee, was perfect.

Merc\'ed\`es was as lovely as one of those Greek women of Cyprus or Chios,
with jet-black eyes and coral lips. She stepped out with the frankness
and freedom of an Arl\'esienne or an Andalusian woman. A city girl might
perhaps have tried to conceal her joy under a veil or at least beneath
the velvet shade of her eyelids, but Merc\'ed\`es smiled and looked at all
those around her; and her look and her smile said as plainly as she
could have in words: if you are my friends, rejoice with me, because I
am truly happy!

As soon as the couple and those accompanying them were in sight of La
R\'eserve, M. Morrel came down and set out to meet them, followed by the
sailors and soldiers: he had stayed with them to renew the promise he
had already made to Dant\`es himself, that he would succeed Captain
Lecl\`ere. Seeing him approach, Edmond let go of his fianc\'ee's arm, which
he placed under M. Morrel's. Thus the shipowner and the young woman gave
a lead by going first up the wooden stairs leading to the room where
dinner was served, and the staircase groaned for five minutes under the
heavy feet of the guests.

`Father,' Merc\'ed\`es said, stopping at the middle of the table, `you go on
my right, I pray you; and on my left, I shall place the one who has been
a brother to me.' She spoke with such softness that it struck Fernand to
the depth of his soul like a blow from a dagger. His lips paled and,
under the tanned colouring of his masculine features, you could once
more see the blood draining bit by bit as it flooded into his heart.

Meanwhile Dant\`es had done the same: on his right, he placed M. Morrel,
and on his left Danglars. Then he signalled to everyone to sit down
wherever they wished.

Already the guests were passing round the strong-smelling Arles sausage
with its brown flesh, crayfish in their dazzling armour, pink-shelled
clams, sea-urchins looking like chestnuts in their spiny cases, and
\emph{clovisses}, those shellfish that gourmets from the South claim are
more than an adequate substitute for the oysters of northern waters; in
short, all the delicate hors-d'oeuvres that are washed up by the waves
on these sandy shores and to which grateful fishermen accord the general
appellation of \emph{fruits de mer}.

`Why this silence?' the old man exclaimed, sipping a glass of a wine as
yellow as topaz, which P\`ere Pamphile in person had just set down in
front of Merc\'ed\`es. `Who would imagine that there are thirty people here
who ask nothing better than to be merry?'

`Huh! A husband is not always merry,' said Caderousse.

`The fact is,' Dant\`es said, `that I am too happy at this moment to be
merry. If that's what you mean, neighbour, you are right. Joy may
sometimes produce strange effects and be as oppressive as sorrow.'

Danglars was watching Fernand, whose impressionable nature absorbed and
reflected his every feeling.

`Come now,' he said. `Have you anything to fear? It seems to me, on the
contrary, that everything is working out as you would wish.'

`That is precisely what terrifies me,' said Dant\`es. `I cannot think that
man is meant to find happiness so easily! Happiness is like one of those
palaces on an enchanted island, its gates guarded by dragons. One must
fight to gain it; and, in truth, I do not know what I have done to
deserve the good fortune of becoming Merc\'ed\`es' husband.'

`Husband! Husband!' Caderousse said, laughing. `Not yet, Captain. Try
behaving like her husband right now and you'll see how she treats you.'

Merc\'ed\`es blushed.

Fernand was shuffling on his chair, starting at the slightest noise and,
from time to time, wiping large beads of sweat from his forehead, which
seemed to have fallen there like the first drops of rain before a storm.

`By heaven, neighbour,' said Dant\`es, `you have no need to give me the
lie for so little. It's true, Merc\'ed\`es is not yet my wife, but \ldots'
(he took out his watch) ` \ldots{} in an hour and a half, she will be!'

There was a gasp of surprise from everyone, except Old Dant\`es, who
exhibited his fine set of teeth in a broad laugh. Merc\'ed\`es smiled and
was no longer blushing. Fernand made a convulsive lunge towards the
handle of his dagger.

`In an hour!' said Danglars, himself going pale. `How is that?'

`Yes, friends,' Dant\`es replied. `Thanks to an advance from Monsieur
Morrel, the man to whom -- after my father -- I owe the most in the
world, all our difficulties have been overcome. We have paid for the
banns and at half-past two the Mayor of Marseille is expecting us at the
Town Hall. Now, since it has just sounded a quarter past one, I think I
am not much mistaken in saying that in one hour and thirty minutes
Merc\'ed\`es will be Madame Dant\`es.'

Fernand closed his eyes. A fiery cloud was burning behind their lids and
he grasped the table to keep himself from fainting; but, despite his
efforts to do so, he could not repress a deep groan that was drowned by
laughter and the congratulations of the guests.

`That's the way to do it, no?' Old Dant\`es said. `What would you say? Has
he wasted any time? Disembarked yesterday morning, married today at
three o'clock! Trust a sailor to get the job done without messing
around.'

`But,' Danglars put in timidly, `what about the other formalities: the
contract, the settlement?'

`The contract!' Dant\`es said with a laugh. `The contract is already made:
Merc\'ed\`es has nothing, and neither have I! We shall be married under a
settlement of common estate, that's all. It took little time to write
out and won't be expensive.'

This sally brought a further round of applause and hurrahs.

`So, what we thought was a betrothal is nothing less than a wedding
feast,' said Danglars.

`Not so,' said Dant\`es. `Don't worry, you won't be missing anything.
Tomorrow morning, I leave for Paris: four days to travel there, four
days to return and a day to carry out my errand conscientiously. On
March the first I shall be back; on March the second, then, we shall
have the real wedding feast.'

The prospect of a second meal increased the level of hilarity to such a
point that Old Dant\`es, who had complained of the silence at the start of
the dinner, was now making futile efforts, in the midst of the general
hubbub, to propose a toast to the prosperity of the happy couple.

Dant\`es guessed what was in his father's mind and replied with a smile
full of filial love. Merc\'ed\`es had started to watch the time on the
cuckoo clock in the room, and she made a sign to Edmond.

Around the table reigned the noisy merriment and freedom of manners
that, among people of the lower orders, are common accompaniments to the
end of a meal. Those who were dissatisfied with their places had got up
from the table and gone to find new neighbours. Everyone had started to
speak at once, and no one was bothering to listen to what the person
next to him was saying, but was concerned only with his own thoughts.

Fernand's pallor was almost reflected on the cheeks of Danglars; as for
Fernand himself, all life appeared to have left him and he was like one
of the damned in a lake of fire. He had been among the first to get up
and was striding backwards and forwards across the room, trying to block
his ears to the sound of songs and clinking glasses.

Caderousse went over to him, just as Danglars, whom he had apparently
been trying to avoid, caught up with him in a corner of the room.

`I must say,' Caderousse remarked, the last remnants of the hatred which
Dant\`es' unexpected good fortune had sowed in his mind having succumbed
to Dant\`es' joviality and, above all, to P\`ere Pamphile's excellent wine.
`Dant\`es is a good fellow and when I see him like this beside his fianc\'ee
I feel that it would have been a pity to play the unkind trick on him
that you were plotting yesterday.'

`Well, then,' Danglars replied, `you can see that the matter went no
further. Poor Monsieur Fernand was so upset that, at first, I felt sorry
for him; but now that he has made up his mind to accept the situation,
to the point of allowing himself to become his rival's best man, there
is nothing more to be said.'

Caderousse looked at Fernand. He was deathly pale.

`The sacrifice is all the greater,' Danglars went on, `as the girl is so
decidedly pretty. Dammit! My future captain is a lucky dog: I wish I
could be in his shoes for just half a day.'

`Shall we go?' Merc\'ed\`es said softly. `It is striking two and we are
expected at a quarter past.'

`Yes, yes, let's go,' Dant\`es exclaimed, leaping to his feet.

`Let's go!' all the guests repeated in unison.

At that moment Danglars, who had not taken his eyes off Fernand where he
was sitting on the window-ledge, saw him look up frantically, rise as
though with a convulsive start, then fall back on to his seat in the
casement. At almost the same moment a dull sound echoed through the
stairway, the sound of heavy footsteps and confused voices, mingled with
the clanking of weapons, which rose above the exclamations of the guests
(loud though these were) and instantly attracted everybody's attention,
creating an uneasy hush.

The sounds drew closer. Three knocks sounded on the door, and all those
in the room looked at their neighbours in astonishment.

`Open, in the name of the law!' cried a voice, in a resounding tone. No
one answered. At once the door flew open and a commissioner of
police,\textsuperscript{1} wearing his sash,
strode into the room, followed by four armed soldiers under the command
of a corporal.

Uneasiness gave way to terror.

`What is wrong?' the shipowner asked, going over to the commissioner,
whom he knew. `Monsieur, there must undoubtedly be some mistake.'

`If there is a mistake, Monsieur Morrel,' the commissioner replied, `you
may be sure that it will soon be put right. In the meanwhile, I have a
warrant here; and though I do it with regret, I must fulfil my duty.
Which of you gentlemen is Edmond Dant\`es?'

All eyes turned towards the young man who, preserving his dignity
despite his astonishment, stepped forward and said: `I am, Monsieur.
What do you want with me?'

`Edmond Dant\`es,' the commissioner said, `I arrest you in the name of the
law.'

`Arrest me!' Edmond said, paling slightly. `Why are you arresting me?'

`I have no idea of that, Monsieur, but you will be informed of it in
your first interrogation.'

M. Morrel realized that there was no sense in trying to argue in the
circumstances: a commissioner wearing his sash is no longer a man but a
statue of the law, cold, deaf and dumb. But the old man rushed over to
the officer: it is impossible, in some situations, to reason with the
heart of a parent.

He begged and prayed: prayers and tears were ineffectual, but his
despair was so great that the commissioner was moved by it.

`My dear sir,' he said, `calm yourself. Perhaps your son has forgotten
some formality to do with the Customs or the health authorities; and, as
likely as not, when he has given them the information they require, he
will be released.'

`Well, I never! What does this mean?' Caderousse asked Danglars
quizzically, while Danglars feigned surprise.

`How can I tell?' he replied. `Like you, I can see what is happening,
but I am at a loss to understand it.'

Caderousse looked around for Fernand, but he had vanished. At that
moment, the whole of the previous evening's events flashed before his
eyes with terrifying clarity. It was as though the catastrophe had
lifted the veil that drunkenness had cast over his memory of the day
before.

`Oh! Oh!' he exclaimed hoarsely. `Can this be a consequence of the joke
you were speaking about yesterday, Danglars? If that is the case,
damnation take the perpetrator, for it is a cruel one.'

`Nothing of the sort!' muttered Danglars. `Far from it: you know very
well that I tore up the paper.'

`That you did not,' said Caderousse. `You merely threw it into a
corner.'

`Hold your tongue. You were drunk, you saw nothing.'

`Where is Fernand?' Caderousse asked.

`How do I know?' replied Danglars. `About his business, no doubt. But
instead of worrying about that, why don't we go and comfort these poor
people.'

While this conversation was taking place, Dant\`es had in effect been
shaking the hands of all his friends, with a smile to each, and
relinquished himself into captivity, saying: `Stay calm. The mistake
will doubtless be explained and it is quite probable that I shall not
even go as far as the prison.'

`Certainly not, I guarantee it,' Danglars said, coming across at that
moment to the group, as he had indicated.

Dant\`es went down the stairs, following the commissioner of police, with
the soldiers surrounding him. A carriage, its door wide open, was
waiting outside. He got in. Two soldiers and the commissioner got up
behind him, the door closed and the carriage set out on the road back to
Marseille.

`Farewell, Dant\`es! Farewell, Edmond!' cried Merc\'ed\`es, leaning across the
balustrade.

The prisoner heard this last cry, wrung like a sob from his fianc\'ee's
tormented heart. He leant out of the carriage window and called:
`Goodbye, Merc\'ed\`es!' as he disappeared round one corner of the Fort
Saint-Nicholas.

`Wait for me here,' said the shipowner. `I shall take the first carriage
I can find, hurry to Marseille and bring the news back to you.'

`Yes!' everyone cried. `Go on, and come quickly back.'

After this double departure there was a dreadful moment of stunned
silence among all who remained behind. For a time, the old man and
Merc\'ed\`es stayed apart, each immured in grief. But at length their eyes
met. Each recognized the other as a victim stricken by the same blow and
they fell into each other's arms.

Meanwhile Fernand returned, poured himself a glass of water, drank it
and sat down on a chair. By chance, this happened to be next to the
chair into which Merc\'ed\`es sank when she parted from the old man's
embrace. Fernand instinctively moved his own chair away.

`He's the one,' Caderousse told Danglars, not having taken his eyes off
the Catalan.

`I doubt it,' Danglars replied. `He was not clever enough. In any case,
let whoever is responsible take the blame.'

`You are forgetting the person who advised him.'

`Pah! If one were to be held to account for every remark one lets fall
\ldots'

`Yes, when it falls point downwards.'

Everyone else, meanwhile, had been discussing every angle of Dant\`es'
arrest.

`And you, Danglars?' someone asked. `What do you think about what has
happened?'

`My view is that he must have brought back some packets of prohibited
goods.'

`But if that was the case, you should know about it, Danglars, since you
were the ship's supercargo.'

`That may be so, but the supercargo doesn't know about any goods unless
they are declared to him. I know that we were carrying cotton, that's
all, and that we took the cargo on at Alexandria, from Monsieur Pastret,
and at Smyrna, from Monsieur Pascal. Don't expect me to know anything
more than that.'

`Yes, I remember now,' Dant\`es' poor father muttered, clutching at this
straw. `He told me yesterday that he had brought me a cask of coffee and
one of tobacco.'

`You see,' said Danglars. `That's it: while we were away, the Customs
must have gone on board the \emph{Pharaon} and discovered the
contraband.'

Merc\'ed\`es did not believe any of this; and, having up to then contained
her distress, she burst into a fit of sobbing.

`Come, come! Don't lose hope,' Old Dant\`es said, though without really
knowing what he was saying.

`Hope!' Danglars repeated.

`Hope,' Fernand tried to mutter. But the word stuck in his throat, his
lips trembled and no sound emerged from them.

`Gentlemen!' cried one of the guests, who had been keeping watch from
the balcony. `Gentlemen, a carriage! Ah, it's Monsieur Morrel! Come now,
he must surely be bringing good news.'

Merc\'ed\`es and the old man ran out to greet the shipowner, who met them at
the door. M. Morrel's face was pale.

`Well?' they all cried at once.

`Well, my friends,' the shipowner replied, shaking his head. `The matter
is more serious than we thought.'

`But, Monsieur!' cried Merc\'ed\`es. `He is innocent!'

`I believe him to be so,' M. Morrel replied, `but he is accused \ldots'

`What is he accused of?' Old Dant\`es asked.

`Of being an agent of Bonaparte.'

Those readers who lived through the period in which this story takes
place will recall what a dreadful accusation it was that M. Morrel had
just pronounced in those days.

Merc\'ed\`es gave a cry, and the old man sank into a chair.

`So,' Caderousse muttered. `You lied to me, Danglars: the trick was
played after all. But I do not intend to let this old man and this young
woman die of grief, and I shall tell them everything.'

`Hold your tongue, wretch!' Danglars exclaimed, grasping Caderousse's
hand. `Otherwise I can't answer for what may happen to you. How do you
know that Dant\`es is not in fact guilty? The ship did call in at the
island of Elba, he landed there and stayed a day in Porto Ferrajo. If he
has been found with some compromising letter on his person, anyone who
takes his part will look like an accomplice.'

Caderousse was rapidly informed of the full strength of this argument by
the dictates of self-interest, and he looked at Danglars with an
expression deadened by fear and grief. Having just taken one step
forward, he proceeded to take two back.

`So, let's wait and see,' he muttered.

`Yes, we'll wait,' Danglars answered. `If he is innocent, he will be
freed; if he is guilty, there is no sense in compromising oneself for
the sake of a conspirator.'

`Let's go, then. I can't stay here any longer.'

`Yes, come on,' said Danglars, delighted at having someone to accompany
him out of the room. `Come, we shall let them extricate themselves as
best they may.'

They left; and Fernand, resuming his former role in support of the young
woman, took Merc\'ed\`es' hand and led her back to Les Catalans. For their
part, Dant\`es' friends took the old man, in a state of near-collapse,
back to the All\'ees de Meilhan.

The news that Dant\`es had just been arrested as a Bonapartist agent soon
spread through Marseille.

`Would you have believed it, my dear Danglars?' M. Morrel said, catching
up with his supercargo and Caderousse (for he was also heading for town
as fast as he could, to have some first-hand news of Edmond from the
crown prosecutor, M. de Villefort, who was a slight acquaintance of
his). `Would you believe it?'

`Well, now, Monsieur!' Danglars replied. `I told you that Dant\`es put
into Elba, for no apparent reason, and that this call seemed suspicious
to me.'

`But did you tell anyone else of your suspicions?'

`I was careful not to do any such thing,' Danglars assured him, lowering
his voice. `You know very well that, on account of your uncle, Monsieur
Policar Morrel, who served under you-know-whom and makes no secret of
his feelings, you are suspected of hankering after the old regime. I
would have been afraid I might harm Dant\`es and also yourself. There are
some things that a subordinate has a duty to tell the owner, and to keep
well hidden from anyone else.'

`Well done, Danglars, well done. You're a good fellow. I had already
thought about you, in the event of poor Dant\`es becoming captain of the
\emph{Pharaon}.'

`How so, Monsieur?'

`Well, you see, I did ask Dant\`es what he thought of you and if he would
have any objection to my leaving you in your post; I don't know why, but
I thought I had noticed some coldness between you.'

`And what was his reply?'

`He told me that he did indeed feel that he had some grievance against
you, though in circumstances that he would not explain; but that anyone
who enjoyed the shipowner's confidence also had his own.'

`Hypocrite!' muttered Danglars.

`Poor Dant\`es,' said Caderousse. `He was an excellent fellow, and that's
a fact.'

`Yes, but meanwhile,' M. Morrel said, `the \emph{Pharaon} has no
captain.'

`Oh, we must hope,' said Danglars, `that, since we cannot sail again for
three months, Dant\`es will be freed before then.'

`Of course, but in the meanwhile?'

`Well, Monsieur Morrel, in the meantime, I am here. As you know, I can
manage a ship as well as the first ocean-going captain who may come
along. It may even benefit you to use me, because when Edmond comes out
of prison you will not have to dismiss anybody: he will quite simply
resume his post and I mine.'

`Thank you, Danglars,' said the shipowner. `That arranges everything. I
therefore authorize you to take command and supervise the unloading:
whatever disaster may befall an individual, business must not suffer.'

`Have no fear, Monsieur. But can we at least go and visit him? Poor
Edmond!'

`I'll let you know as soon as I can, Danglars. I shall try to speak to
Monsieur de Villefort and intercede with him on the prisoner's behalf. I
know that he is a rabid Royalist; but, dammit, though he's a Royalist
and the crown prosecutor, he is also a man and not, I believe, a wicked
one.'

`No,' said Danglars. `Though I have heard it said that he is ambitious,
which is much the same.'

`Well, we shall find out,' M. Morrel said, with a sigh. `Go on board and
I'll join you there.'

He left the two friends, to make his way towards the law courts.

`You see how things are turning out?' Danglars said to Caderousse. `Do
you still want to go and speak for Dant\`es?'

`No, indeed not. But it is dreadful that a trick should have such dire
consequences.'

`Pah! Who played the trick? Not you or I. You know very well that I
threw the paper into a corner. I even thought I had torn it up.'

`No, no,' Caderousse insisted. `As far as that goes, I am certain. I can
see it in the corner of the arbour, screwed up in a ball -- and I wish
it were still in the place where I saw it.'

`What do you expect? Fernand must have picked it up, copied it or had it
copied; perhaps he did not even take that trouble; which means \ldots{}
Good Lord! Suppose he sent my own letter! Luckily I disguised my
handwriting.'

`But did you know that Dant\`es was a conspirator?'

`Did I know? I knew nothing at all. As I told you, I was making a joke,
that's all. It seems that, like Harlequin, I spoke a true word in jest.'

`No matter,' said Caderousse. `I'd give a great deal for this not to
have happened, or at least not to be involved in it. You wait and see,
Danglars! It will bring us misfortune!'

`If it brings misfortune, it will be to the guilty party, and the real
responsibility lies with Fernand, not with us. What ill do you suppose
could befall us? All we have to do is to keep quiet and not breathe a
word of this, and the storm will blow over without striking us.'

`Amen!' Caderousse said, waving goodbye to Danglars and making his way
towards the All\'ees de Meilhan, shaking his head and muttering to
himself, as people are inclined to do when they have a good deal on
their minds.

`Good!' Danglars exclaimed. `Everything is working out as I expected. I
am now captain \emph{pro tem} and, if only that idiot Caderousse can
keep his mouth shut, captain for good. So, the only other eventuality is
that the Law may release Dant\`es? Ah, well,' he added, with a smile, `the
Law is the Law, and I am happy to put myself in her hands.'

Upon which, he leapt into a boat and gave the boatman the order to row
him out to the \emph{Pharaon} where the shipowner, as you will recall,
had arranged to meet him.

\chapternotes{Marseille -- Arrival}

\mynote{\emph{Fort Saint-Jean}: The entrance to the
old harbour at Marseille is guarded by two forts, the Fort Saint-Jean on
the north and the Fort Saint-Nicholas on the south. The Pharo lies west
of the Fort Saint-Nicholas, and Les Catalans south-west. In the standard
text, some place-names are misspelt (`Morgion' for `Morgiou', etc.).
These have been corrected, to accord with Schopp (1993).

The new harbour was under construction, north of Fort Saint-Jean, at the
time when the novel was published. The city rises away from the old
harbour, or Vieux Port, forming -- in the words of \emph{Murray's
Handbook for Travellers in France} (London, 1847) `a basin or
amphitheatre, terminating only with the encircling chain of hills. From
this disposition of the ground, the port becomes the sewer of the city
-- the receptacle of all its filth, stagnating in a tideless sea and
under a burning sun \ldots{} The stench emanating from it at times is
consequently intolerable, except for natives \ldots'

On the whole, Marseille was not considered attractive for tourists, and
Dumas' novel did a good deal to enhance its image.

\mynote{\emph{supercargo}: On a merchant ship, the
officer in charge of the cargo and of finances.

\mynote{\emph{for Marshal Bertrand}: Marshal Bertrand
(1773--1844) was one of Napoleon's marshals. He followed the emperor to
exile on Elba.

\mynote{the Italian proverb: chi ha compagno,
ha padrone\emph{: `Whoever has a partner, has a master'.}
}

\chapternotes{Father and Son}

\mynote{\emph{a hundred louis}: All sums of money have
been left as in the original text. The \emph{louis} was a gold coin
worth 24 francs: the franc had become the standard unit of currency
after 1795, divided into 100 \emph{centimes} (or 10 \emph{d\'ecimes}).
However, a number of denominations continued in circulation, including
the \emph{louis}, the \emph{livre} (equal to the franc), the \emph{\'ecu}
and others.

Equivalents are hard to assess. The exchange rate, in the first half of
the nineteenth century, was 25 francs to the pound sterling (so one
\emph{louis} was worth just under a pound). The fare by mail coach from
Paris to Marseille, via Lyon, was around 145 francs, or nearly 6 pounds
(though, as we see in Chapter {\small CVI}, Albert manages
to do it for 114 francs, by using river transport for part of the
journey). This may sound like a bargain to travellers on French
Railways, but one must remember (as Coward points out in his edition of
the 1846 translation) that a cur\'e's stipend was only 1,000 francs (£40)
a year.
